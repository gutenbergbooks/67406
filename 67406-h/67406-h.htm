<h2 class="nobreak">WHY</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> years ago circumstances thrust me into a
position in which it became possible for the friend who
figures in these pages as Godfrey Loring to do me a
favor. He, being both wise and kindly, never misses a
good chance to put another under obligations. He did
me the favor. I gratefully, if reluctantly, acquiesced.
Now, after many days, he collects. When you shall have
read what follows, you may utterly reject my extenuating
plea that any and every point of view upon life
is worthy of attention, even though it serve only to
confirm us in our previous ideas and beliefs. You may
say that I should have repudiated my debt, should have
refused to edit and publish the manuscript he confided
to me. You may say that the general racial obligation
to mankind&mdash;and to womankind&mdash;takes precedence over
a private and personal obligation. Unfortunately I
happen to be not of the philanthropic temperament.
My sense of the personal is strong; my sense of the
general weak&mdash;that is to say, weak in comparison. If
&#8220;Loring&#8221; had been within reach, I think I should have
gone to him and pleaded for release. But as luck will
have it, he is off yachting, to peep about in the remote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
inlets and islets of Australasia and the South Seas for
several years.</p>

<p>To aggravate my situation, in the letter accompanying
the manuscript, after several pages of the discriminating
praise most dear to a writer&#8217;s heart, he did me
the supreme honor of saying that in his work he had
&#8220;striven to copy as closely as might be your style and
your methods&mdash;to help me to the hearing I want and
to lighten your labors as editor.&#8221; I assure him and the
public that in any event I should have done little editing
of his curious production beyond such as a proofreader
might have found necessary. As it is, I have
done practically no editing at all. In form and in substance,
from title to finis, the work is his. I am merely
its sponsor&mdash;and in circumstances that would forbid me
were I disposed to qualify my sponsorship with even
so mild a disclaimer as reluctance.</p>

<p>Have I said more than a loyal friend should? If so,
on the other hand, have I not done all that a loyal friend
could?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> tempted to begin with our arrival in Fifth Avenue,
New York City, in the pomp and circumstance befitting
that region of regal splendor. I should at once
catch the attention of the women; and my literary
friends tell me that to make any headway with a story
in America it is necessary to catch the women, because
the men either do not read books at all or read
only what they hear the women talking about. And I
know well&mdash;none knows better&mdash;that our women of the
book-buying class, and probably of all classes, love to
amuse their useless idleness with books that help them
to dream of wasting large sums of money upon luxuries
and extravagances, upon entertaining grand people in
grand houses and being entertained by them. They tell
me, and I believe it, that our women abhor stories of
middle-class life, abhor truth-telling stories of any kind,
like only what assures them that the promptings of their
own vanities and sentimental shams are true.</p>

<p>But patience, gentle reader, you with the foolish,
chimera-haunted brain, with the silly ideas of life, with
the ignorance of human nature including your own self,
with the love of sloppy and tawdry clap trap. Patience,
gentle reader. While I shall begin humbly in the
social scale, I shall not linger there long. I shall pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
on to the surroundings of grandeur that entrance your
snobbish soul. You will soon smell only fine perfumes,
only the aromas of food cooked by expensive chefs.
You will sit in drawing-rooms, lie in bedrooms as magnificent
as the architects and decorators and other purveyors
to the very rich have been able to concoct. You
will be tasting the fine savors of fashionable names and
titles recorded in Burke&#8217;s and the &#8220;Almanach de
Gotha.&#8221; Patience, gentle reader, with your box of caramels
and your hair in curl papers and your household
work undone&mdash;patience! A feast awaits you.</p>

<p>There has been much in the papers these last few
years about the splendid families we&mdash;my wife and I&mdash;came
of. Some time ago one of the English dukes&mdash;a
nice chap with nothing to do and a quaint sense of
humor&mdash;assembled on his estate for a sort of holiday
and picnic all the members of his ancient and proud
family who could be got together by several months of
diligent search. It was a strange and awful throng that
covered the lawns before the ducal castle on the appointed
day. There was a handful of fairly presentable,
more or less prosperous persons. But the most of the
duke&#8217;s cousins, near and remote, were tramps, bartenders,
jail birds, women of the town, field hands male and
female, sewer cleaners, chimney sweeps, needlewomen,
curates, small shopkeepers, and others of the species
that are as a stench unto delicate, aristocratic nostrils.
The duke was delighted with his picnic, pronounced it
a huge success. But then His Grace had a sense of
humor and was not an American aristocrat.</p>

<p>All this by way of preparation for the admission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
that the branch of the Loring family from which I come
and the branch of the Wheatlands family to which the
girl I married belongs were far from magnificent, were
no more imposing then, well, than the families of any
of our American aristocrats. Like theirs, our genealogical
tree, most imposingly printed and bound and
proudly exhibited on a special stand in the library of
our New York palace&mdash;that genealogical tree, for all
its air of honesty, for all its documentary proofs, worm-eaten
and age-stained, was like an artificial palm bedded
in artificial moss. The truth is, aristocracy does not
thrive in America, but only the pretense of it, and that
must be kept alive by constant renewals. Both here and
abroad I am constantly running across traces of illegitimacy,
substitution, and other forms of genealogical flim-flam.
But let that pass. Whoever is or is not aristocratic,
certainly Godfrey Loring and Edna Wheatlands
are not&mdash;or, rather, <i>were</i> not.</p>

<p>My father kept a dejected little grocery in Passaic,
N. J. He did not become a &#8220;retired merchant and capitalist&#8221;
until I was able to retire and capitalize him.
Edna&#8217;s father was&mdash; No, you guess wrong. Not a
butcher, but&mdash;an undertaker!... Whew! I am glad
to have these shameful secrets &#8220;off the chest,&#8221; as they
say in the Bowery. He&mdash;this Wheatlands, undertaker
to the poor and near-poor of the then village of Passaic&mdash;was
a tall, thin man, with snow-white hair and a
smooth, gaunt, gloomy face and the best funeral air I
have ever seen. Edna has long since forgotten him; she
has an admirable ability absolutely to forget anything
she may for whatever reason deem it inconvenient to remember.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
What an aid to conscience is such a quality!
But I have not forgotten old Weeping Willy Wheatlands,
and I shall not forget him. It was he who loaned
me my first capital, the one that&mdash; But I must not
anticipate.</p>

<p>In those days Passaic was a lowly and a dreary village.
Its best was cheap enough; its poorest was
wretchedly squalid. The &#8220;seat&#8221; of the Lorings and
the &#8220;seat&#8221; of the Wheatlands stood side by side on the
mosquito beset banks of the river&mdash;two dingy frame cottages,
a story and a half in height, two rooms deep.
We Lorings had no money, for my father was an honest,
innocent soul with a taste for talking what he thought
was politics, though in fact he knew no more of the realities
of politics, the game of pull Dick pull Devil for
licenses to fleece a &#8220;free, proud and intelligent people&#8221;&mdash;he
knew no more of that reality than&mdash;than the next
honest soul you may hear driveling on that same subject.
We had no money, but &#8220;Weeping Willie&#8221; had
plenty&mdash;and saved it, blessings on him! I hate to
think where I should be now, if he hadn&#8217;t hoarded! So,
while our straightened way of living was compulsory,
that of the Wheatlands was not. But this is unimportant;
the main point is both families lived in the same
humble way.</p>

<p>If I thought &#8220;gentle reader&#8221; had patience and real
imagination&mdash;and, yes, the real poetic instinct&mdash;I should
give her an inventory of the furniture of those two cottages,
and of the meager and patched draperies of the
two Monday wash lines, as my mother and Edna&#8217;s
mother&mdash;and Edna, too, when she grew big enough&mdash;decorated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
them, the while shrieking gossip back and
forth across the low and battered board fence. But I
shall not linger. It is as well. Those memories make
me sad&mdash;put a choke in my throat and a mist before my
eyes. Why? If you can&#8217;t guess, I could not in spoiling
ten reams of paper explain it to you. One detail only,
and I shall hasten on. Both families lived humbly, but
we not quite so humbly as the Wheatlands family, because
my mother was a woman of some neatness and energy
while Ma Wheatlands was at or below the do-easy,
slattern human average. <i>We</i> had our regular Saturday
bath&mdash;in the wash tub. <i>We</i> did not ever eat off the
stove. And while we were patched we were rarely
ragged.</p>

<p>In those days&mdash;even in those days&mdash;Edna was a
&#8220;scrapper.&#8221; They call it an &#8220;energetic and resolute
personality&#8221; now; it was called &#8220;scrappy&#8221; then, and
scrappy it was. When I would be chopping wood or
lugging in coal, so occupied that I did not dare pause,
she would sit on the fence in her faded blue-dotted calico,
and how she would give it to me! She knew how to say
the thing that made me wild with the rage a child is
ashamed to show. Yes, she loved to tease me, perhaps&mdash;really,
I hope&mdash;because she knew I, in the bottom
of my heart, loved to be teased by her, to be noticed in
any way. And mighty pretty she looked then, with her
mop of yellowish brown hair and her big golden brown
eyes and her little face, whose every feature was tilted
to the angle that gives precisely the most fascinating
expression of pretty pertness, of precocious intelligence,
or of devil-may-care audacity. She has always been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
pretty woman, has Edna, and always will be, even in
old age, I fancy. Her beauty, like her health, like that
strong, supple body of hers, was built to last. What
is the matter with the generations coming forward now?
Why do they bloom only to wither? What has sapped
their endurance? Are they brought up too soft? Is it
the food? Is it the worn-out parents? Why am I, at
forty, younger in looks and in strength and in taste for
life than the youths of thirty? Why is Edna, not five
years my junior, more attractive physically than girls
of twenty-five or younger?</p>

<p>But she was only eight or nine at the time of which
I am writing. And she was fond of me then&mdash;really
fond of me, though she denied it furiously when the
other children taunted, and though she was always jeering
at me, calling me awkward and homely. I don&#8217;t
think I was notably either the one or the other, but for
her to say so tended to throw the teasers off the track
and also kept me in humble subjection. I knew she
cared, because when we played kissing games she would
never call me out, would call out every other boy, but
if I called any other girl she would sulk and treat me
as badly as she knew how. Also, while she had nothing
but taunts and sarcasms for me she was always to be
found in the Wheatlands&#8217; back yard near the fence or
on it whenever I was doing chores in our back yard.</p>

<p>After two years in the High School I went to work
in the railway office as a sort of assistant freight clerk.
She kept on at school, went through the High School,
graduated in a white dress with blue ribbons, and then
sat down to wait for a husband. Her father and mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
were sensible people. Heaven knows they had led a
hard enough life to have good sense driven into them.
But the tradition&mdash;the lady-tradition&mdash;was too strong
for them. They were not ashamed to work, themselves.
They would have been both ashamed and angry had it
been suggested to them that their two boys should become
idlers. But they never thought of putting their
daughter to work at anything. After she graduated
and became a young lady, she was not compelled&mdash;would
hardly have been permitted&mdash;to do housework or sewing.
You have seen the potted flower in the miserable
tenement window&mdash;the representative of the life that
neither toils nor spins, but simply exists in idle beauty.
That potted bloom concentrates all the dreams, all the
romantic and poetic fancies of the tenement family. I
suppose Edna was some such treasured exotic possession
to those toil-twisted old parents of hers. They wanted
a flower in the house.</p>

<p>Well, they had it. She certainly was a lovely girl,
far too lovely to be spoiled by work. And if ever there
was a scratch or a stain on those beautiful white hands of
hers, it assuredly was not made by toil. She took music
lessons&mdash; Music lessons! How much of the ridiculous,
pathetic gropings after culture is packed into those two
words. Beyond question, everyone ought to know something
about music; we should all know something about
everything, especially about the things that peculiarly
stand for civilization&mdash;science and art, literature and
the drama. But how foolishly we are set at it! Instead
of learning to understand and to appreciate music, we
are taught to &#8220;beat the box&#8221; in a feeble, clumsy fashion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
or to screech or whine when we have no voice worth
the price of a single lesson. Edna took I don&#8217;t know how
many lessons a week for I don&#8217;t know how many years.
She learned nothing about music. She merely learned to
strum on the piano. But, after all, the lessons attained
their real object. They made Edna&#8217;s parents and Edna
herself and all the neighbors feel that she was indeed
a lady. She could not sew. She could not cook. She
hadn&#8217;t any knowledge worth mention of any practical
thing&mdash;therefore, had no knowledge at all; for, unless
knowledge is firmly based upon and in the practical, it
is not knowledge but that worst form of ignorance, misinformation.
She didn&#8217;t know a thing that would help
her as woman, wife, or mother. But she could play the
piano!</p>

<p>Some day some one will write something true on the
subject of education. You remember the story of the
girl from Lapland who applied for a place as servant
in New York, and when they asked her what she could
do, she said, &#8220;I can milk the reindeer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I never hear the word education that I don&#8217;t think
of that girl. One half of the time spent at school, to
estimate moderately, and nine tenths of the time spent
in college class rooms is given to things about as valuable
to a citizen of this world as the Lap girl&#8217;s &#8220;education&#8221;
to a New York domestic. If anyone tells you
that those valueless things are culture, tell him that only
an ignorance still becalmed in the dense medi&aelig;val fog
would talk such twaddle; tell him that science has taught
us what common sense has always shown, that there is no
beauty divorced from use, that beauty is simply the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
perfect adaptation of the thing to be used to the purpose
for which it is to be used. I am a business man,
not a smug, shallow-pated failure teaching in an antiquated
college. I abhor the word culture, as I abhor
the word gentleman or the word lady, because of the
company into which it has fallen. So, while I eagerly
disclaim any taint of &#8220;culture,&#8221; I insist that I know
what I&#8217;m talking about when I talk of education. And
if I had not been too good-natured, my girl&mdash; But I
must keep to the story. &#8220;Gentle reader&#8221; wants a
story; he&mdash;or she&mdash;does not want to try to think.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to my ignorant ears to hear Edna
playing sonatas and classical barcaroles and dead
marches and all manner of loud and difficult pieces.
Such sounds, issuing from the humble&mdash;and not too
clean&mdash;Wheatlands house gave it an atmosphere of
aristocracy, put tone into the whole neighborhood, elevated
the Wheatlands family like a paper collar on the
calico shirt of a farm hand. If we look at ourselves
rightly, we poor smattering seekers after a little showy
knowledge of one kind or another&mdash;a dibble of French,
a dabble of Latin or Greek, a sputter of woozy so-called
philosophy&mdash;how like the paper-collared farm hand we
are, how like the Hottentot chief with a plug hat atop
his naked brown body.</p>

<p>But Edna pleased me, fully as much as she pleased
herself, and that is saying a great deal. I wouldn&#8217;t
have had her changed in the smallest particular. I was
even glad she could get rid of her freckles&mdash;fascinating
little beauty spots sprinkled upon her tip-tilted little
nose!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>She was not so fond of me in those days. I had a
rival. I am leaning back and laughing as I think of
him. Charley Putney! He was clerk in a largish dry
goods store. He is still a clerk there, I believe, and no
doubt is still the same cheaply scented, heavily pomatumed
clerkly swell he was in the days when I feared
and hated him. The store used to close at six o&#8217;clock.
About seven of summer evenings Charley would issue
forth from his home to set the hearts of the girls to fluttering.
They were all out, waiting. Down the street
he would come with his hat set a little back to show
the beautiful shine and part and roach of his hair. The
air would become delicious (!) with bergamot, occasionally
varied by German cologne or lemon verbena.
What a jaunty, gay tie! What an elegant suit! And
he wore a big seal ring, reputed to be real gold&mdash;and
such lively socks! Down the street came Charley, all
the girls palpitant. At which stoop or front gate
would he stop?</p>

<p>Often&mdash;only too often&mdash;it was at the front gate
next ours. How I hated him!</p>

<p>And the cap of the joke is that Edna nearly married
him. In this land where the social stairs are crowded
like Jacob&#8217;s Ladder with throngs ascending and descending,
what a history it would make if the grown men and
women of any generation should tell whom they <i>almost</i>
married!</p>

<p>Yes, Edna came very near to marrying him. She
was a lady. She did not know exactly what that meant.
The high-life novels she read left her hazy on the subject,
because to understand any given thing we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
have knowledge that enables us to connect it with the
things we already know. A snowball would be an unfathomable
mystery to a savage living in an equatorial
plain. A matter of politics or finance or sociology or
real art, real literature, real philosophy, seems dull and
meaningless to a woman or to the average mutton-brained
man. But if you span the gap between knowledge
of any subject and a woman&#8217;s or a man&#8217;s ignorance
of that subject with however slender threads of connecting
knowledge, she or he can at once bridge it and
begin to reap the new fields. Edna could not find any
thread whatever for the gap between herself and that
fairy land of high life the novels told her about. In
those days there was no high life in Passaic. I suppose
there is now&mdash;or, at least, Passaic thinks there is&mdash;and
in purely imaginary matters the delusion of possession
is equal to, even better than, possession itself.
So, with no high life to use as a measure, with only the
instinct that her white smooth hands and her dresses
modeled on the latest Paris fashions as illustrated in the
monthly &#8220;Lady Book,&#8221; and her music lessons, her taste
for what she then regarded as literature&mdash;with only her
instinct that all these hallmarks must stamp her twenty-four
carat lady, she had to look about her for a matching
gentleman. And there was Charley, the one person
within vision who suggested the superb heroes of the
high-life novels. I will say to the credit of her good
taste that she had her doubts about Charley. Indeed,
if his sweet smell and his smooth love-making&mdash;Charley
excelled as a love-maker, being the born ladies&#8217; man&mdash;if
the man, or, rather, the boy, himself had not won her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
heart, she would soon have tired of him and would have
suspected his genuineness as a truly gentleman. But
she fell in love with him.</p>

<p>There was a long time during which I thought the
reason she returned to me&mdash;or, rather, let me return to
her&mdash;was because she fell out of love with him. Then
there was a still longer time when I thought the reason
was the fact that the very Saturday I got a raise to fourteen
a week, he fell from twelve to eight. But latterly
I have known the truth. How many of us know the
truth, the down-at-the-bottom, absolute truth, about
why she married us instead of the other fellow? Very
few, I guess&mdash;or we&#8217;d be puffing our crops and flirting
our feathers less cantily. She took up with me again
because he dropped her. It was he that saved her, not
she or I. Only a few months ago, her old mother, doddering
on in senility, with memory dead except for early
happenings, and these fresh and vivid, said: &#8220;And
when I think how nigh Edny come to marryin&#8217; up with
that there loud-smelling dude of a Charley Putney! If
he hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a give her the go by, she&#8217;d sure &#8217;a made a
fool of herself&mdash;a wantin&#8217; me and her paw to offer him
money and a job in the undertakin&#8217; store, to git him
back. Lawsy me! What a narrer squeak fur Princess
Edny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Be patient, gentle reader! You shall soon be reading
things that will efface the coarse impression my old
mother-in-law&#8217;s language and all these franknesses about
our beginnings must have made upon your refined and
cultured nature. Swallow a caramel and be patient.
But don&#8217;t skip these pages. If you should, you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
miss the stimulating effect of contrast, not to speak of
other benefits which I, probably vainly, hope to confer
upon you.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t love me. Looking back, I see that for
many months she found it difficult to endure me. But it
was necessary that she carry off&mdash;with the neighborhood
rather than with me&mdash;her pretense of having cast
off Charley because she preferred me. We can do wonders
in the way of concealing wounded pride; we can do
equal wonders in the way of preserving a reputation
for unbroken victory. And I believe she honestly liked
me. Perhaps she liked me even more than she liked her
aromatic Charley; for, it by no means follows that we
like best where we love most. I am loth to believe&mdash;I
do not believe&mdash;that at so early an age, not quite seventeen,
she could have received my caresses and returned
them with plausibility enough to deceive me, unless she
had genuinely liked me.</p>

<p>And what a lucky fellow I thought myself! And
how I patronized the perfumed man. And what a
thrashing I gave him&mdash;poor, harmless, witless creature!&mdash;when
I heard of his boastings that he had dropped
Edna Wheatlands because he found Sally Simpson prettier
and more <i>cultured</i>!</p>

<p>I must have been a railway man born. At twenty-two&mdash;no,
six months after my majority&mdash;I was jumped
into a head clerkship at twelve hundred a year. Big
pay for a youngster in those days; not so bad for a
youngster even in these inflated years. When I brought
Edna the news I think she began to love me. To her
that salary was a halo, a golden halo round me&mdash;made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
me seem a superior person. She had long thought
highly of my business abilities, for she was shrewd and
had listened when the older people talked, and they were
all for me as the likeliest young man of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had another raise,&#8221; said I carelessly. We were
sitting on her front porch, she upon the top step, I
two steps down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why, the last was only
two months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;ve pushed me up to twelve hundred a
year&mdash;a little more, for it&#8217;s twenty-five per.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; she exclaimed, and I can see her pretty face
now&mdash;all aglow, beaming a reverent admiration upon me.</p>

<p>I rather thought I deserved it. But it has ever
been one of my vanities to pretend to take my successes
as matters of course, and even to depreciate them. They
say the English invariably win in diplomacy because
they act dissatisfied with what they get, never grumbling
so sourly as when they capture the whole hog. I can
believe it. That has been my policy, and it has worked
rather well. Still, any policy works well if the man has
the gift for success. &#8220;Twenty-five per,&#8221; I repeated, to
impress it still more deeply upon her and to revel in the
thrilling words. &#8220;Before I get through I&#8217;ll make them
pay me what I&#8217;m worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;ll ever be making more than
that?&#8221; exclaimed she, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be getting two thousand some day,&#8221; said I, far
more confidently than I felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;Godfrey!&#8221; she said softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>And as I looked at her I for the first time felt a certain
peculiar thrill that comes only when the soul of the
woman a man loves rushes forth to cling to his soul.
In my life I have never had&mdash;and never shall have&mdash;a
happier moment.</p>

<p>Once more patience, gentle reader! I know this bit
of sordidness&mdash;this glow of sentiment upon a vulgar material
incident&mdash;disgusts your delicate soul. I am aware
that you have a proper contempt for all the coarse details
of life. You would not be <i>gentle</i> reader if you
hadn&#8217;t. You would be a plain man or woman, living
busily and usefully, and making people happy in the
plain ways in which the human animal finds happiness.
You would not be devoting your days to making soul-food
out of idealistic moonshine and dreaming of ways
to dazzle yourself and your acquaintances into thinking
you a superior person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said my pretty Edna, advancing
her bond at least halfway toward meeting mine, &#8220;do
you know, I&#8217;ve had an instinct, a presentiment of this?
I was dreaming it when I woke up this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve observed that every woman in her effort to prove
herself &#8220;not like other girls&#8221; pretends to some occult
or other equally supranatural quality. One dreams
dreams. Another gets spirit messages. A third has
seen ghosts. Another has a foot which sculptors have
longed to model. A fifth has a note in her voice which
the throat specialists pronounce unique in the human
animal and occurring only in certain rare birds and
Sarah Bernhardt. I met one not long ago who had
several too many or too few skins, I forget which, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
as a result was endowed with I cannot recall what
nervous qualities quite peculiar to herself, and somehow
most valuable and fascinating. In that early stage of
her career my Edna was &#8220;hipped&#8221; upon a rather commonplace
personal characteristic&mdash;the notion that she
had premonitions, was a sort of seeress or prophetess.
Later she dropped it for one less tiresome and overworked.
But I recall that even in that time of my deepest
infatuation I wished to hear as little as possible
about the occult. Of all the shallow, foggy fakes that
attract ignorant and miseducated people the occult is
the most inexcusable and boring. A great many people,
otherwise apparently rather sensible, seem honestly to
believe in it. But, being sensible, they don&#8217;t have anything
to do with it. They treat it as practical men
treat the idiotic in the creeds and the impossible in the
moral codes of the churches to which they belong&mdash;that
is, they assent and proceed to dismiss and to forget.</p>

<p>However, I was not much impressed by Edna&#8217;s attempt
to dazzle me with her skill as a Sibyl. But I was
deeply impressed by the awe-inspiring softness and
shapeliness of her hand lying prisoner in mine. And I
was moved to the uttermost by the kisses and embraces
we exchanged in the gathering dusk. &#8220;I love you,&#8221; she
murmured into my ecstatic ear. &#8220;You are so different
from the other men round here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dilated with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far ahead of them in every way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahead of Charley Putney?&#8221; said I, jocose but
jealous withal.</p>

<p>She laughed with a delightful look of contemptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
scorn in her cute face. &#8220;Oh, <i>he</i>!&#8221; she scoffed. &#8220;He&#8217;s
getting only eight a week, and he&#8217;ll never get any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if his boss has sense,&#8221; said I, thinking myself
judicial. &#8220;But let&#8217;s talk about ourselves. We can be
married now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I advanced this timidly, for being a truly-in-love
lover I was a little afraid of her, a little uncertain of
this priceless treasure. But she answered promptly,
&#8220;Yes, I was thinking of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it right away,&#8221; proposed I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not for several weeks. It wouldn&#8217;t be proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t explain. She only knew that there was
something indecent about haste in such matters, that
the procedure must be slow and orderly and stately.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll marry the first of next month,&#8221; she finally decided,
and I joyfully acquiesced.</p>

<p>Some of my readers&mdash;both of the gentle and of the
other kind&mdash;may be surprised that a girl of seventeen
should be so self-assured, so independent. They must
remember that she was a daughter of the people; and
among the people a girl of seventeen was, and I suppose
still is, ready for marriage, ready and resolved to decide
all important matters for herself. At seventeen
Edna, in self-poise and in experience, judgment and all
the other mature qualities, was the equal of the carefully
sheltered girl of twenty-five or more. She may have
been brought up a lady, may have been in all essential
ways as useless as the most admired of that weariful
and worthless class. But the very nature of her surroundings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
in that simple household and that simple
community, had given her a certain practical education.
And I may say here that to it she owes all she is to-day.
Do not forget this, gentle reader, as you read
about her and as she dazzles you. As you look at the
gorgeous hardy rose do not forget that such spring
only from the soil, develop only in the open.</p>

<p>That very evening we began to look for a home.
As soon as we were outside her front gate she turned
in the direction of the better part of the town. Nor
did she pause or so much as glance at a house until we
were clear of the neighborhood in which we had always
lived, and were among houses much superior. I admired,
and I still admire, this significant move of hers.
It was the gesture of progress, of ambition. It was
splendidly American. I myself should have been content
to settle down near our fathers and mothers, among the
people we knew. I should no doubt have been better
satisfied to keep up the mode of living to which we had
been used all our lives. The time would have come
when I should have reached out for more comfort and for
luxury. But it was natural that she should develop in
this direction before I did. She had read her novels
and her magazines, had the cultured woman&#8217;s innate
fondness for dress and show, had had nothing but those
kinds of things to think about; I had been too busy
trying to make money to have any time for getting
ideas about spending it.</p>

<p>No; while her motive in seeking better things than
we had known was in the main a vanity and a sham, her
action had as much <i>initial</i> good in it as if her motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
had been sensible and helpful. And back of the motive
lay an instinct for getting up in the world that has
been the redeeming and preserving trait in her character.
It was this instinct that ought to have made
her the fit wife for an ambitious and advancing man.
You will presently see how this fine and useful instinct
was perverted by vanity and false education and the pernicious
example of other women.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rents are much higher in this neighborhood,&#8221;
said I, with a doubtful but admiring look round at the
pretty houses and their well-ordered grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But maybe we can find
something. Anyway, it won&#8217;t do any harm to look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; I assented, for I liked the idea myself.
This better neighborhood <i>looked</i> more like her than her
own, seemed to her lover&#8217;s eyes exactly suited to her
beauty and her stylishness&mdash;for the &#8220;Lady Book&#8221; was
teaching her to make herself far more attractive to the
eye than were the other girls over in our part of town.
I still puzzle at why Charley Putney gave her up; the
only plausible theory seems to be that she was so sick
in love with him that she wearied him. The most attractive
girl in the world, if she dotes on a young man too
ardently, will turn his stomach, and alarm his delicate
sense of feminine propriety.</p>

<p>As we walked on, she with an elate and proud air,
she said: &#8220;How different it smells over here!&#8221;</p>

<p>At first I didn&#8217;t understand what she meant. But,
as I thought of her remark, the meaning came. And I
believe that was the beginning of my dissatisfaction with
what I had all my life had in the way of surroundings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
I have since observed that the sense of smell is blunt,
is almost latent, in people of the lower orders, and that
it becomes more acute and more sensitive as we ascend
in the social scale. Up to that time my ambition to
rise had been rather indefinite&mdash;a desire to make money
which everyone seemed to think was the highest aim in
life&mdash;and also an instinct to beat the other fellows working
with me. Now it became definite. I began to smell.
I wanted to get away from unpleasant smells. I do not
mean that this was a resolution, all in the twinkling of
an eye. I simply mean that, as everything must have
a beginning, that remark of hers was for me the beginning
of a long and slow but steady process of what
may be called civilizing.</p>

<p>Presently she said: &#8220;If we couldn&#8217;t afford a house,
we might take one of the flats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;d be lonesome, away off from
everybody we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tossed her head. &#8220;A good lonesome,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of <i>common</i> people. I was reading about reincarnations
the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; laughed I. &#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>She explained&mdash;as well as she could&mdash;probably as
well as anybody could. I admired her learning but the
thing itself did not interest me. &#8220;I guess there must be
something in it,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure in a former
life I was something a lot different from what I am now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; I assured her, putting my
arm round her in the friendly darkness of a row of sidewalk
elms.</p>

<p>When we had indulged in an interlude of love-making,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
she returned to the original subject. &#8220;I wonder
how much rent we could afford to pay,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say the rent ought never to be more per
month than the income is per week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we could pay twenty-five a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>That seemed to me a lot to pay&mdash;and, indeed, it was.
But she did not inherit Weeping Willie&#8217;s tightness;
and she had never had money to spend or any training
in either making or spending money. That is to say,
she was precisely as ignorant of the main business of
life as is the rest of American womanhood under our
ridiculous system of education. So, twenty-five dollars
a month rent meant nothing to her. &#8220;We can&#8217;t do
anything to-night,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got my days
free, and I&#8217;ll look at different places, and when I find
several to choose from we can come in the evening or
on Sunday and decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>This suited me exactly. We dismissed the matter,
hunted out a shady nook, and sat down to enjoy ourselves
after the manner of young lovers on a fine night.
Never before had she given herself freely to love. I
know now it was because never before had she loved me.
I was deliriously happy that night, and I am sure she
was too. She no less than I had the ardent temperament
that goes with the ambitious nature; and now that she
was idealizing me into the man who could lead her to the
fairy lands she dreamed of, she gave me her whole heart.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of what was beyond question
the happiest period of both our lives. I have a dim
old photograph of us two taken about that time. At a
glance you see it is the picture of two young people of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the working class&mdash;two green, unformed creatures,
badly dressed and gawkily self-conscious. But there is
a look in her face&mdash;and in mine&mdash; To be quite honest,
I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t look like that now. I wouldn&#8217;t go back
if I could. Nevertheless&mdash; How we loved each other!&mdash;and
how happy we were!</p>

<p>I feel that I weary you, gentle reader. There is in
my sentiment too much about wages and flat rents and
the smells that come from people who work hard and
live in poor places and eat badly cooked strong food.
But that is not my fault. It is life. And if you believe
that your and your romancers&#8217; tawdry imaginings are
better than life&mdash;well, you may not be so wise or so exalted
as you fancy.</p>

<p>The upshot of our inspecting places to live and haggling
over prices was that we took a flat in the best
quarter of Passaic&mdash;the top and in those elevatorless
days the cheapest flat in the house. We were to pay
forty dollars a month&mdash;a stiff rent that caused excitement
in our neighborhood and set my mother and her
father to denouncing us as a pair of fools bent upon
ruin. I thought so, myself. But I could have denied
Edna nothing at that time, and I made up my mind that
by working harder than ever at the railway office I
would compel another raise. When I told my mother
about this secret resolve of mine, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do get more money, Godfrey, don&#8217;t tell
Edna. She&#8217;s a fool. She&#8217;ll keep your nose to the grindstone
all your life if you ain&#8217;t careful. It takes a better
money-maker than you&#8217;re likely to be to hold up against
that kind of a woman.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s like all girls,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; replied my mother. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
I ain&#8217;t got no use for women. Look what poor managers
they are. Look how they idle and waste and run
into debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s a lot to be said against the men, too.
Saloons, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And talkin&#8217; politics with loafers,&#8221; said my father&#8217;s
wife bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the trouble with men and women is they&#8217;re
too human,&#8221; said I, who had inherited something of the
philosopher from my father. &#8220;And, mother, a man&#8217;s
got to get married&mdash;and he&#8217;s got to marry a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose he has,&#8221; she grudgingly assented.
&#8220;Mighty poor providers most of the men is, and mighty
poor use the women make of what little the men brings
home. But about you and Edny Wheatlands&mdash; You
ought to do better&#8217;n her, Godfrey. You&#8217;re caught by
her looks and her style and her education. None of
them things makes a good wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly wouldn&#8217;t marry a girl that didn&#8217;t have
them&mdash;all three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s something more,&#8221; insisted mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;One woman can&#8217;t have everything,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but she can have what I mean&mdash;and she&#8217;s not
much good to a man without it. If you&#8217;re set on marrying
her wait till <i>you&#8217;re</i> ready, anyhow. <i>She</i> never will
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till you&#8217;ve got money in the savings bank.
Wait till you&#8217;ve got used to having money. Then maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
you&#8217;ll be able to put a bit on a spendthrift wife even
if you are crazy about her. You&#8217;re making a wrong
start with her, Godfrey. You&#8217;re giving her the upper
hand, and that&#8217;s bad for women like her&mdash;mighty bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was from my mother that I get my ability at business.
She and I often had sensible talks, and her advice
started me right in the railroad office and kept me right
until I knew my way. So I did not become angry at
her plain speaking, but appreciated its good sense, even
though I thought her prejudiced against my Edna.
However, I had not the least impulse to put off the marriage.
My one wish was to hasten it. Never before
or since was time so leisurely. But the day dragged
itself up at last, and we were married in church, at
what seemed to us then enormous expense. There was
a dinner afterward at which everyone ate and drank
too much&mdash;a coarse and common scene which I will spare
gentle reader. Edna and I went up to New York City
for a Friday to Monday honeymoon. But we were back
to spend Sunday night in our grand forty-dollar flat.
On Monday morning I went to work again&mdash;a married
man, an important person in the community.</p>

<p>Never has any height I have attained or seen since
equalled the grandeur of that forty-dollar flat. My
common sense tells me that it was a small and poor
affair. I remember, for example, that the bathroom
was hardly big enough to turn round in. I recall that
I have sat by the window in the parlor and without
rising have reached a paper on a table at the other end
of the room. But these hard facts in no way interfere
with or correct the flat as my imagination persists in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
picturing it. What vistas of rooms!&mdash;what high ceilings&mdash;what
woodwork&mdash;and plumbing!&mdash;and what magnificent
furniture! Edna&#8217;s father, in a moment of generosity,
told her he would pay for the outfitting of the
household. And being in the undertaking business he
could get discounts on furniture and even on kitchen
utensils. Edna did the selecting. I thought everything
wonderful and, as I have said, my imagination
refuses to recreate the place as it actually was. But I
recall that there was a brave show of red and of plush,
and we all know what that means. Whether her &#8220;Lady
Book&#8221; had miseducated her or her untrained eyes, excited
by the gaudiness she saw when she went shopping,
had beguiled her from the counsels of the &#8220;Lady Book,&#8221;
I do not know. But I am sure, as I recall red and plush,
that our first home was the typical horror inhabited by
the extravagant working-class family.</p>

<p>No matter. There we were in Arcadia. For a time
her restless soaring fancy, wearied perhaps by its audacious
flight to this lofty perch of red and plush and
forty dollars a month, folded its wings and was content.
For a time her pride and satisfaction in the luxurious
newness overcame her distaste and disdain and moved
her to keep things spotless. I recall the perfume of
cleanness that used to delight my nostrils at my evening
homecoming, and then the intoxicating perfume of Edna
herself&mdash;the aroma of healthy young feminine beauty.
We loved each other, simply, passionately, in the old-fashioned
way. With the growth of intelligence, with
the realization on the part of men that her keep is a
large part of the reason in the woman&#8217;s mind if not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
her heart for marrying and loving, there has come a
decline and decay of the former reverence and awe of
man toward woman. Also, the men nowadays know
more about the mystery of woman, know everything
about it, where not so many years ago a pure woman
was to a man a real religious mystery. Her physical
being, the clothes she wore underneath, the supposedly
sweet and clean thoughts, nobler than his, that dwelt
in the temple of her soul&mdash;these things surrounded a
girl with an atmosphere of thrilling enigma for the
youth who won from her lips and from the church the
right to explore.</p>

<p>All that has passed, or almost passed. I am one
of those who believe that what has come, or, rather, is
coming, to take its place is better, finer, nobler. But
the old order had its charm. What a charm for me!&mdash;who
had never known any woman well, who had dreamed
of her passionately but purely and respectfully. There
was much of pain&mdash;of shyness, fear of offending her
higher nature, uneasiness lest I should be condemned
and cast out&mdash;in those early days of married life. But
it was a sweet sort of pain. And when we began to understand
each other&mdash;to be human, though still on our
best behavior&mdash;when we found that we were congenial,
were happy together in ways undreamed of, life seemed
to be paying not like the bankrupt it usually is when
the time for redeeming its promises comes but like a
benevolent prodigal, like a lottery whose numbers all
draw capital prizes. I admit the truth of much the
pessimists have to say against Life. But one thing I
must grant it. When in its rare generous moments it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
relents, it does know how to play the host at the feast&mdash;how
to spread the board, how to fill the flagons and
to keep them filled, how to scatter the wreaths and the
garlands, how to select the singers and the dancers who
help the banqueters make merry. When I remember
my honeymoon, I almost forgive you, Life, for the
shabby tricks you have played me.</p>

<p>Now I can conceive a honeymoon that would last
on and on, not in the glory and feverish joy of its first
period, but in a substantial and satisfying human happiness.
But not a honeymoon with a wife who is no
more fitted to be a wife than the office boy is fitted to
step in and take the president&#8217;s job. Patience, gentle
reader! I know how this sudden shriek of discord across
the amorous strains of the honeymoon music must have
jarred your nerves. But be patient and I will explain.</p>

<p>Except ourselves, every other family in the house,
in the neighborhood, had at least one servant. We had
none. If Edna had been at all economical we might
have kept a cook and pinched along. But Edna spent
carelessly all the money I gave her, and I gave her
all there was. A large part of it went for finery for
her personal adornment, trash of which she soon tired&mdash;much
of it she disliked as soon as it came home and she
tried it on without the saleslady to flatter and confuse.
I&mdash;in a good-natured way, for I really felt perfectly
good-humored about it&mdash;remonstrated with her for letting
everybody rob her, for getting so little for her
money. She took high ground. Such things were beneath
her attention. If I had wanted a wife of that
dull, pinch-penny kind I&#8217;d certainly not have married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
her, a talented, educated woman, bent on improving her
mind and her position in the world. And that seemed
reasonable. Still, the money was going, the bills were
piling up, and I did not know what to do.</p>

<p>And&mdash;she did the cooking. I think I have already
said that she had not learned to cook. How she and
her mother expected her to get along as a poor clerk&#8217;s
wife I can&#8217;t imagine. The worst of it was, she believed
she could cook. That is the way with women. They
look down on housekeeping, on the practical side of life,
as too coarse and low to be worthy their attention.
They say all that sort of thing is easy, is like the toil
of a day laborer. They say anybody could do it. And
they really believe so. Men, no matter how high their
position, weary and bore themselves every day, because
they must, with routine tasks beside which dishwashing
has charm and variety. Yet women shirk their proper
and necessary share of life&#8217;s burden, pretending that it
is beneath them.</p>

<p>Edna, typical woman, thought she could cook and
keep house because she, so superior, could certainly do
inferior work if she chose. But after that first brief
spurt of enthusiasm, of daily conference with the &#8220;Lady
Book&#8217;s Complete Housekeeper&#8217;s Guide,&#8221; the flat was
badly kept&mdash;was really horribly kept&mdash;was worse than
either her home or mine before we had been living there
many months. It took on much the same odor. It
looked worse, as tawdry finery, when mussy and dirty,
is more repulsive than a plain toilet gone back. I did
not especially mind that. But her cooking&mdash; I had
not been accustomed to anything especially good in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
way of cooking. Mother was the old-fashioned fryer,
and you know those fryers always served the vegetables
soggy. I could have eaten exceedingly poor stuff
without complaining or feeling like complaining. But
the stuff she was soon flinging angrily upon the slovenly
table I could not eat. She ate it, enough of it to keep
alive, and it didn&#8217;t seem to do her any harm. How
many women have you known who were judges of things
to eat? Do you understand how women continue to eat
the messes they put into their pretty mouths, and keep
alive?</p>

<p>I could not eat Edna&#8217;s cooking. I ate bread, cold
meats and the like from the delicatessen shop. When
the meal happened to be of her own preparing I dropped
into the habit of slipping away after a pretense at eating,
to get breakfast or dinner or supper in a restaurant&mdash;the
cheapest kind of restaurant, but I ate there
with relish. And never once did I murmur to Edna. I
loved her too well; also, I am by nature a tolerant,
even-tempered person, hating strife, avoiding the harsh
word. In fact, my timidity in that respect has been
my chief weakness, has cost me dear again and again.
But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>After ten months of married life Edna fell ill. All
you married men will prick up your ears at that. Why
is it that bread winners somehow contrive to keep on
their feet most of the time, little though they know as
to caring for their health, reckless though they are in
eating and drinking? Why is it that married women&mdash;unless
they have to work&mdash;spend so much time in sick
bed or near it? They say we in America have more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
than nine times as many doctors proportionately to
population as any other country. The doctors live off
of our women&mdash;our idle, overeating, lazy women who will
not work, who will not walk, who are always getting
something the matter with them. Of course the doctors&mdash;parasites
upon parasites&mdash;fake up all kinds of lies,
many of them malicious slanders against the husbands,
to excuse their patients and to keep them patients. But
what is the truth?</p>

<p>Edna, who read all the time she was not plotting to
get acquainted with our neighbors&mdash;they looked down
upon us and wished to have nothing to do with us&mdash;Edna
who ate quantities of candy between meals and
ate at meals rich things she bought of confectioners
and bakers&mdash;Edna fell ill and frightened me almost out
of my senses. I understand it now. But I did not
understand then. I believed, as do all ignorant people&mdash;both
the obviously ignorant and the ignorant who
pass for enlightened&mdash;I believed sickness to be a mysterious
accident, like earthquakes and lightning strokes,
a hit-or-miss blow from nowhere in particular. So I
was all sympathy and terror.</p>

<p>She got well. She looked as well as ever. But she
said she was not strong. &#8220;And Godfrey, we simply
have got to keep a girl. I&#8217;ve borne up bravely. But
I can&#8217;t stand it any longer. You see for yourself, the
rough work and the strain of housekeeping are too much
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said I. The bills, including the doctor&#8217;s
and drug bills, were piling up. We were more
than a thousand dollars in debt. But I said: &#8220;Very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
well. You are right.&#8221; We men do not realize that there
are two distinct and equal expressions of strength. The
strength of bulk, that is often deceptive in that it looks
stronger than it is; the strength of fiber, that is always
deceptive in that it is stronger than it looks. In a general
way, man has the strength of bulk, woman the
strength of fiber. So man looks on woman&#8217;s appearance
of fragility and fancies her weak and himself the
stronger. I looked at Edna, and said: &#8220;Very well. We
must have a girl to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shan&#8217;t linger upon this part of my story. I am
tempted to linger, but, after all, it is the commonplace of
American life, familiar to all, though understood apparently
by only a few. Why do more than ninety per cent
of our small business men fail? Why are the savings
banks accounts of our working classes a mere fraction of
those of the working classes of other countries? And so
on, and so on. But I see your impatience, gentle reader,
with these matters so &#8220;inartistic.&#8221; We sank deeper and
deeper in debt. Edna&#8217;s health did not improve. The
girl we hired had lived with better class people; she despised
us, shirked her work, and Edna did not know
how to manage her. If the head of the household is
incompetent and indifferent, a servant only aggravates
the mess, and the more servants the greater the mess.
All Edna&#8217;s interest was for her music, her novels, her
social advancement, and her dreams of being a grand
lady. These dreams had returned with increased power;
they took complete possession of her. They soured her
disposition, made her irritable, usually blue or cross,
only at long intervals loving and sweet. No, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the dreams were not responsible. Perhaps&mdash;probably&mdash;the
real cause was the upset state of her health
through the absurd idle life she led. Idle and lonely.
For she would not go with whom she could, she could
not go with whom she would.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of sitting alone,&#8221; said she. &#8220;No wonder
I can&#8217;t get well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back near the old folks,&#8221; suggested I.
&#8220;Our friends won&#8217;t come to see us in this part of the
town. They feel uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think they would!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;And if
they came I&#8217;d see to it that they were so uncomfortable
that they would never come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I worked hard. My salary went up to fifteen hundred,
to two thousand, to twenty-five hundred. &#8220;Now,&#8221;
said Edna, &#8220;perhaps you&#8217;ll get hands that won&#8217;t look
like a laboring man&#8217;s. How can I hope to make nice
friends when I&#8217;ve a husband with broken finger nails?&#8221;</p>

<p>Our expenses continued to outrun my salary, but I
was not especially worried, for I began to realize that
I had the money-making talent. Three children were
born; only the first&mdash;Margot&mdash;lived. Looking back
upon those six years of our married life, I see after the
first year only a confused repellent mess of illness,
nurses, death, doctors, quarrels with servants, untidy
rooms and clothes, slovenly, peevish wife, with myself
watching it all in a dazed, helpless way, thinking it must
be the normal, natural order of domestic life&mdash;which,
indeed, it is in America&mdash;and wondering where and how
it was to end.</p>

<p>I recall going home one afternoon late, to find Edna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
yawning listlessly over some book in a magazine culture
series. Her hair hung every which way, her wrapper
was torn and stained. Her skin had the musty look
that suggests unpleasant conditions both without and
within. Margot, dirty, pimply from too much candy,
sat on the floor squalling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the child away,&#8221; cried Edna, at sight of me.
&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d never come. A little more of this and
I&#8217;ll kill myself. What is there to live for, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Silent and depressed, I took Margot for a walk.
And as I wandered along sadly I was full of pity for
Edna, and felt that somehow the blame was wholly mine
for the wretched plight of our home life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I was twenty-eight and Edna twenty-three, I
had a series of rapid promotions which landed me in
New York in the position of assistant traffic superintendent.
My salary was eight thousand a year.</p>

<p>It so happened&mdash;coincidence and nothing else&mdash;that
those eighteen months of quick advance for me also
marked a notable change in Edna.</p>

<p>There are some people&mdash;many people&mdash;so obsessed
of the know-it-all vanity that they can learn nothing.
Nor are all these people preachers, doctors, and teachers,
gentle reader. Then there is another species who
pretend to know all, who are chary of admitting to
learning or needing to learn anything, however small,
yet who behind their pretense toil at improving themselves
as a hungry mouse gnaws at the wall of the
cheese box. Of this species was Edna. As she was fond
of being mysterious about her thoughts and intentions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
she never told me what set her going again after that
long lethargy. Perhaps it was some woman whom she
had a sudden opportunity thoroughly to study, some
woman who knew and lived the ideas Edna had groped
for in vain. Perhaps it was a novel she read or articles
in her magazines. It doesn&#8217;t matter. I never asked
her; I had learned that wild horses would not drag from
her a confession of where she had got an idea, because
such a confession would to her notion detract from her
own glory. However, the essential fact is that she suddenly
roused and set to work as she had never worked
before&mdash;went at it like a prospector who, after toiling
now hard and now discouragedly for years, strikes by
accident a rich vein of gold. Edna showed in every
move that she not hoped, not believed, but knew she was
at last on the right track. She began to take care,
scrupulous care, of her person&mdash;the minute intelligent
care she has ever since been expanding and improving
upon, has never since relaxed, and never will relax. Also
she began to plan and to move definitely in the matter
of taking care of Margot&mdash;to look after her speech, her
manners, her food, her person, especially, perhaps, the
last. Margot&#8217;s teeth, Margot&#8217;s hair, Margot&#8217;s walk,
Margot&#8217;s feet and hands and skin, the shape of her nose,
the set of her ears&mdash;all these things she talked about and
fussed with as agitatedly as about her own self.</p>

<p>Edna became a crank on the subject of food&mdash;what
is called a crank by the unthinking, of whom, by the
way, I was to my lasting regret one until a few years
ago. For a year or two her moves in this important
direction were blundering, intermittent, and not always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
successful&mdash;small wonder when there is really no reliable
information to be had, the scientists being uncertain and
the doctors grossly ignorant. But gradually she
evolved and lived upon a &#8220;beauty diet.&#8221; Margot, of
course, had to do the same. She took exercises morning
and night, took long and regular walks for the figure
and skin and to put clearness and brightness into the
eyes. I believe she and Margot, with occasional lapses,
keep up their regimen to this day.</p>

<p>The house was as slattern as ever. The diet and
comfort and health of the family bread-winner were no
more the subject of thought and care than&mdash;well, than
the next husband&#8217;s to his wife. She gave some attention&mdash;intelligent
and valuable attention, I cheerfully concede&mdash;to
improving my speech, manners, and dress.
But beyond that the revolution affected only her and
her daughter. Them it affected amazingly. In three
or four months the change in their appearance was
literally beyond belief. Edna&#8217;s beauty and style came
back&mdash;no, burst forth in an entirely new kind of radiance
and fascination. As for little Margot, she transformed
from homeliness, from the scrawny pasty look
of bad health, from bad temper, into as neat and sweet
and pretty a little lady as could be found anywhere.</p>

<p>You, gentle reader, who are ever ready to slop over
with some kind of sentimentality because in your shallowness
you regard sentimentality&mdash;not sentiment, for
of that you know nothing, but sentimentality&mdash;as the
most important thing in the world, just as a child regards
sickeningly rich cake as the finest food in the
world&mdash;you, gentle reader, have already made up your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
mind why Edna thus suddenly awakened, or, rather, reawakened.
&#8220;Aha,&#8221; you are saying. &#8220;Served him good
and right. She found some one who appreciated her.&#8221;
That guess of yours shows how little you know about
Edna or the Edna kind of human being. The people
who do things in this world, except in our foolish American
novels, do because they must. They may do better
or worse under the influence of love, which is full as
often a drag as a spur. But they do not <i>do</i> because
of love. I shall not argue this. I shrink from gratuitously
inviting an additional vial of wrath from the
ladies, who resent being told how worthless they in their
indolence and self-complacence permit themselves to be
and how small a positive part they now play in the
world drama. I should have said nothing at all about
the matter, were it not that I wish to be strictly just
to Edna, and she, being wholly the ambitious woman,
has always had and still has a deep horror of scandal,
intrigue, irregularity, and unconventionality of every
sort.</p>

<p>It was necessary that we move to a place more convenient
to my business headquarters in New York City.
A few weeks after I got the eight thousand a year,
Edna, and little Margot and I went to Brooklyn to
live&mdash;took a really charming house in Bedford Avenue,
with large grounds around it. And once more we were
happy. It seemed to me we had started afresh.</p>

<p>And we had.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> did we go to Brooklyn?</p>

<p>By the time Edna and I had been married six years
I learned many things about her inmost self. I was
not at all analytic or critical as to matters at home. I
used my intelligence in my own business; I assumed that
my wife had intelligence and that she used it in her
business&mdash;her part of our joint business. I believed
the reason her part of it went badly was solely the
natural conditions of life beyond her control. A railroad,
a factory could be run smoothly; a family and a
household were different matters. And I admired my
wife as much as I loved her, and regarded her as a
wonderful woman, which, indeed, in certain respects she
was.</p>

<p>But I had discovered in her several weaknesses.
Some of these I knew; others I did not permit myself
to know that I knew. For example, I was perfectly
aware that she was not so truthful as one might
be. But I did not let myself admit that she was not
always unconscious of her own deviations from the
truth. I had gained enough experience of life to learn
that lying is practically a universal weakness. So I
did not especially mind it in her, often found it amusing.
I had not then waked up to the fact that, as a
rule, women systematically lie to their husbands about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
big things and little, and that those women who profess
to be too proud to lie, do their lying by indirections,
such as omissions, half truths, and misleading
silences. I am not criticising. Self-respect, real personal
pride, I have discovered in spite of the reading
matter of all kinds about the past, is a modern development,
is still in embryo; and those of us who profess to
be the proudest are either the most ignorant of ourselves
or the most hypocritical.</p>

<p>But back to my acquaintance with my wife&#8217;s character.
When I told her we should have to live nearer
my work, my new work, than Passaic, she promptly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not to New York?&#8221; said I. &#8220;At least until
I get thoroughly trained, I want to be close to the
office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s Margot,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Margot must
have a place to play in. And we couldn&#8217;t afford such a
place in New York. I can&#8217;t let her run about the streets
or go to public schools. She&#8217;d pick up all sorts of low,
coarse associates and habits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go to some town opposite&mdash;across the
Hudson. If we can&#8217;t live on Manhattan Island, and I
think you&#8217;re right about Margot, why, let&#8217;s live where
living is cheap. We ought to be saving some money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate these Jersey towns,&#8221; said Edna petulantly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Margot would get the right sort of
social influences in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as she said &#8220;social influences&#8221; I should
have understood the whole business. The only person
higher up on the social ladder with whom Edna had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
able to scrape intimate acquaintance in Passaic was a
dowdy, tawdry chatterbox of a woman&mdash;I forget her
name&mdash;who talked incessantly of the fashionable people
she knew in Brooklyn&mdash;how she had gone there a stranger,
had joined St. Mary&#8217;s Episcopal Church, and had
at once become a social favorite, invited to &#8220;the very
best houses, my dear; such lovely homes,&#8221; and associated
with &#8220;the most charming cultured people,&#8221; and
so on and on&mdash;you know the rest of the humbug.</p>

<p>Now, one of the discoveries about my wife which I
but half understood and made light of, had been that
she was mad, literally mad, on the subject of social
climbing. That means she was possessed of the disease
imported into this country from England, where it has
raged for upward of half a century&mdash;the disease of being
bent upon associating by hook or by crook with people
whose strongest desire seems to be not to associate with
you. This plague does not spare the male population&mdash;by
no means. But it rages in and ravages the female
population almost to a woman. Our women take incidental
interest or no interest in their homes, in their
husbands, in their children. Their hearts are centered
upon social position, and, of course, the money-squandering
necessary to attaining or to keeping it. The
women who are &#8220;in&#8221; spend all their time, whatever
they may seem to be about, in spitting upon and kicking
the faces of the women who are trying to get &#8220;in.&#8221;
The women who are trying to get &#8220;in&#8221; spend their
whole time in smiling and cringing and imploring and
plotting and, when it seems expedient, threatening and
compelling. Probe to the bottom&mdash;if you have acuteness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
enough, which you probably haven&#8217;t&mdash;probe to the
bottom any of the present-day activities of the American
woman, I care not what it may be, and you will
discover the bacillus of social position biting merrily
away at her. If she goes to church or to a lecture or
a concert&mdash;if she goes calling or stays at home&mdash;if she
joins a suffrage movement or a tenement reform propaganda,
or refuses to join&mdash;if she dresses noisily or
plainly&mdash;if she shuns society or seeks it, if she keeps
house or leaves housekeeping to servants, roaches, and
mice&mdash;if she cares for or neglects her children&mdash;if she
pets her husband or displaces him with another&mdash;no
matter what she does, it is at the behest of the poison
flowing through brain and vein from the social-position
bacillus. She thinks by doing whatever she does she
will somehow make her position more brilliant or less
insecure, or, having no position at all, will gain one.</p>

<p>And the men? They pay the bills. Sometimes reluctantly,
again eagerly; sometimes ignorantly, again
with full knowledge. The men&mdash;they pay the bills.</p>

<p>Now you know better far than I knew at the time
why our happy little family went to Brooklyn, took
the house in Bedford Avenue which we could ill afford
if we were to save any money, and joined St. Mary&#8217;s.</p>

<p>A couple of years after we were married my wife
stopped me when I was telling her what had happened
at the office that day, as was my habit. &#8220;You ought
to leave all those things outside when you come home,&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>She had read this in a book somewhere, I guess. It
was a new idea to me. &#8220;Why should I?&#8221; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;Home is a place for happiness, with all the sordidness
shut out,&#8221; explained she. &#8220;Those sordid things
ought not to touch our life together.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sounded all right. &#8220;It seemed to me,&#8221; stammered
I, apologetically, &#8220;that my career, the way I
was getting on, that our bread and butter&mdash; Well, I
thought we ought to kind of talk it over together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do sympathize with you,&#8221; said, or rather
quoted, she. &#8220;But my place is to soothe and smooth
away the cares of business. You ought to try not to
think of them at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what <i>would</i> I think about?&#8221; cried I, much
perplexed. &#8220;Why, my business is all I&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s the
most important thing in the world to us. It means our
living. At least that&#8217;s the way the thing looks to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to think at home about the higher side
of life&mdash;the intellectual side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my business <i>is</i> my intellectual side,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;And I can&#8217;t for the life of me see why thinking about
things that don&#8217;t advance us and don&#8217;t pay the bills is
better than thinking about things that do.&#8221; It seemed
to me that this looking on my business as something
to be left on the mud-scraper at the entrance indicated
a false idea of it got somewhere. So I added somewhat
warmly: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing low or bad about my business.&#8221;
And that was the truth at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; replied she with
the gentle patience of her superior refinement and education.
&#8220;And I don&#8217;t want to know. Those things
don&#8217;t interest me. And I think, Godfrey&#8221;&mdash;very
sweetly, with her cheek against mine&mdash;&#8220;the reason husbands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
and wives often grow apart is that the husband
gives his whole mind to his business and doesn&#8217;t develop
the higher side of his nature&mdash;the side that appeals to
a woman and satisfies her.&#8221;</p>

<p>This touched my sense of humor mildly. &#8220;My
father gives his mind to one of those high sides,&#8221; said
I, &#8220;and we nearly starved to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father!&#8221; exclaimed she in derisive disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; said I cheerfully, &#8220;he does nothing
but read, talk, and think politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Politics! <i>That</i> isn&#8217;t on the higher side. Women
don&#8217;t care anything about <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do they care about?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;About music and literature&mdash;and those artistic
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those things are all right,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t see that it takes any more brains or any better
brains to paint a picture or sing a song or write a
novel than it does to run a railroad&mdash;or to plan one.
If you&#8217;d try to understand business, dear,&#8221; I urged,
&#8220;you might find it as interesting and as intellectual as
anything that doesn&#8217;t help us make a living. Anyhow,
I&#8217;ve simply got to give my brains to my work. You
go ahead and attend to the higher side for the family.
I&#8217;ll stick to the job that butters the bread and keeps the
rain off.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was patient with me, but I saw she didn&#8217;t approve.
However, as I knew she&#8217;d approve still less if
I failed to provide for her and the two young ones&mdash;there
were two at that time&mdash;I let the matter drop and
held to the common-sense course. I hadn&#8217;t the faintest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
notion of the seriousness of that little talk of ours.
And it was well I hadn&#8217;t, for to have made her realize
her folly I&#8217;d have had to start in and educate her&mdash;uneducate
her and then re&euml;ducate her. I don&#8217;t blame the
women. I feel sorry for them. When I hear them talk
about the lack of sympathy between themselves and
American men, about the low ideals and the sordid talk
the men indulge in, how dull it is, how different from the
inspiring, cultured talk a woman hears among the aristocrats
abroad, said aristocrats being supported in
helpless idleness throughout their useless lives, often by
hard-earned American dollars&mdash;when I hear this pitiful
balderdash from fair lips, I grow sad. The American
woman fancies she is growing away from the American
man. The truth is that while she is sitting still,
playing with a lapful of the artificial flowers of fake
culture, like a poor doodle-wit, the American man is
growing away from her. She knows nothing of value;
she can do nothing of value. She has nothing to offer
the American man but her physical charms, for he has
no time or taste for playing with artificial flowers
when the world&#8217;s important work is to be done. So
the poor creature grows more isolated, more neglected,
less respected, and less sought, except in a physical
way. And all the while she hugs to her bosom the
delusion that she is the great soul high sorrowful. The
world moves; many are the penalties for the nation or
the race or the sex that does not move with it, or does
not move quickly enough. I feel sorry for the American
woman&mdash;unless she has a father who will leave her rich
or a husband who will give her riches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>I feel some of my readers saying that I must have
been most unfortunate in the women I have known.
Perhaps. But may it not be that those commiserating
readers have been rarely fortunate in their feminine
acquaintances?&mdash;or in lack of insight?</p>

<p>Now you probably not only know why we went to
Brooklyn, but also what we did after we got there. I
have not forgotten my promise to gentle reader. I
shall not linger many moments in Brooklyn. True, it
is superior to Passaic, at least to the part of Passaic
in which I constrained gentle reader to tarry a minute
or two. But it is still far from the promised heights.</p>

<p>My wife owes a vast deal to Brooklyn. As she
haughtily ignores the debt, would deny it if publicly
charged, I shall pay it for her. Brooklyn was her finishing
school. It made her what she is.</p>

<p>In the last year or so we spent in Passaic there had
been, as I have hinted, a marked outward change in all
three of us. The least, or rather the least abrupt,
change had been in me. Associated in business with a
more prosperous and better-dressed and better-educated
class of men, I had gradually picked up the sort of
knowledge a man needs to fit himself for the inevitably
changing social conditions accompanying a steady advance
in material prosperity. I was as quick to learn
one kind of useful thing as another. And just as I
learned how to fill larger and larger positions and how
to make money out of the chances that come to a man
situated where money is to be made, so I learned how to
dress like a man of the better class, how to speak a less
slangy and a less ungrammatical English, how to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
my mind in thinking and in discussing a thousand subjects
not directly related to my business.</p>

<p>If my wife had been interested in any of the important
things of the world, I could have been of the
greatest assistance to her and she to me. And we
should have grown ever closer together in sympathetic
companionship. But although she had a good mind&mdash;a
superior mind&mdash;she cared about nothing but the
things that interest foolish women and still more foolish
men&mdash;for a man who cares about splurge and show
and social position and such nonsense is less excusable,
is more foolish, than a woman of the same sort.
Women have the excuse of lack of serious occupation,
but what excuse has a man? Still, she was not idle&mdash;not
for a minute. She was, on the contrary, in her
way as busy as I. From time to time she would say
to me enigmatically: &#8220;You don&#8217;t appreciate it, but I
am preparing myself to help you fill the station your
business ability will win us a chance at.&#8221; It seemed to
me that I was doing that alone. For what was necessary
to fill that station but higher and higher skill as
a man of affairs?</p>

<p>When we had made our entry in Brooklyn and had
seated ourselves in the state in Bedford Avenue which
she had decided for, she showed that she felt immensely
proud of herself. We took the house furnished
throughout&mdash;nicely furnished in a substantial way,
for it had been the home of one of the old Brooklyn
mercantile families.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good enough to start with,&#8221; said she, casting
a critical glance round the sober, homelike dining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
room. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t make any changes till I look about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t be better off,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Everything
is perfectly comfortable.&#8221; And in fact neither she nor
I had ever before known what comfort was. Looking
at that house&mdash;merely looking at it and puzzling out
the uses of the various things to us theretofore unknown&mdash;was
about as important in the way of education as
learning to read is to a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good enough for Brooklyn,&#8221; said she. She
regarded me with her patient, tender expression of the
superior intelligence. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t much imagination
or ambition, Godfrey,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;But fortunately
<i>I</i> have. And do be careful not to betray us before the
servants I&#8217;m engaging.&#8221;</p>

<p>The show part of the house continued to look about
as it had when we took possession. But the living part
went to pieces rapidly. We had many servants. We
spent much money&mdash;so much that, if I had not been
speculating in various ways, we should have soon gone
under. But the results were miserably poor. My wife
left everything to her servants and devoted herself to
her social career. The ex-Brooklyn society woman at
Passaic had not deceived her. No sooner had she joined
St. Mary&#8217;s than she began to have friends&mdash;friends of
a far higher social rank than she had ever even seen
at close range before. They were elegant people indeed&mdash;the
wives of the heads of departments in big
stores, the families of bank officers and lawyers and
doctors. There were even a few rather rich people.
My wife was in ecstasy for a year or two. And she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
improved rapidly in looks, in dress, in manners, in
speech, in all ways except in disposition and character.</p>

<p>Except in disposition and character. As we grow
older and rise in the world, there is always a deterioration
both in disposition and in character. A man&#8217;s disposition
grows sharper through dealing with, and having
to deal sharply with, incompetence. The character
tends to harden as he is forced to make the unpleasant
and often not too scrupulous moves necessary to getting
himself forward toward success. Also, the way
everyone tries to use a successful man makes him more
and more acute in penetrating to the real motives of
his fellow beings, more and more inclined to take up
men for what he can get out of them and drop them
when he has squeezed out all the advantage&mdash;in brief,
to treat them precisely as they treat him. But the
whole object in having a home, a wife, a family, is defeated
if the man has not there a something that checks
the tendencies to cynicism and coldness which active
life not merely encourages but even compels.</p>

<p>There was no occasion for Edna&#8217;s becoming vixenish
and hard. It was altogether due to the idiotic and
worthless social climbing. She had a swarm of friends,
yet not a single friend. She cultivated people socially,
and they cultivated her, not for the natural and kindly
and elevating reasons, but altogether for the detestable
purposes of that ghastly craze for social position.
Edna was bitter against me for a long time, never again
became fully reconciled, because I soon flatly refused to
have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will think there&#8217;s something wrong about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
you, and about me, if you don&#8217;t come with me,&#8221; pleaded
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need my strength for my business,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;And what do I care whether they think well or ill of
me? They don&#8217;t give us any money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are <i>so</i> sordid!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;m
almost tempted to give up, and not try to be somebody
and to make somebodies of Margot and you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we
live quietly and mind our own business and be happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How fortunate it is for Margot that she has a
mother with ambition and pride!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;no matter. But please do get another
cook. This one is, if anything, worse than the last&mdash;except
when we have company.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were forever changing cooks. The food that
came on our table was something atrocious. I heard
the same complaint from all my married associates at
the office, even from the higher officials who were rich
men and lived in great state. They, too, had American
wives. In the markets and shops I saw as I passed
along all sorts of attractive things to eat, and of real
quality. I wondered why we never had those things
on our table. Heaven knows we spent money enough.
The time came when I got a clew to the mystery.</p>

<p>One day Edna said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing my housekeeping
altogether by telephone. I think I&#8217;ll stop it,
except on rainy days and when I don&#8217;t feel well.&#8221;</p>

<p>By telephone! I laughed to myself. No wonder we
had poor stuff and paid the highest prices for it. I
thought a while, then to satisfy my curiosity began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
ask questions, very cautiously, for Edna was extremely
touchy, as we all are in matters where in our hearts
we know we are in the wrong. &#8220;Do you remember
what kind of range we have in our kitchen?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; exclaimed she disgustedly. &#8220;Certainly not.
I haven&#8217;t been down to the kitchen since we first moved
into this house. I&#8217;ve something better to do than to
meddle with the servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; said I soothingly. And I didn&#8217;t let
her see how her confession amused me. What if a man
tried to run his business in that fashion! And ordering
by telephone! Why, it was an invitation to the tradespeople
to swindle us in every way. But I said nothing.</p>

<p>As usually either it was bad weather or Edna was
not feeling well, or was in a rush to keep some social
engagement, the ordering for the house continued to
be done by telephone, when it was not left entirely to the
discretion of the servants. One morning it so happened
that she and I left the house at the same time. Said
she:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on my way to do the marketing. It&#8217;s a terrible
nuisance, and I know so little about those things. But
it&#8217;s coming to be regarded as fashionable for a woman
to do her own marketing. Some of the best families&mdash;people
with their own carriages and servants in livery&mdash;some
of the swellest ladies in Brooklyn do it now. It&#8217;s
a fad from across the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be careful not to overtax yourself,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>And I said it quite seriously, for in those days of my
innocence I was worried about her, thought her a poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
overworked angel, was glad I had the money to relieve
her from the worst tasks and to leave her free to amuse
herself and to take care of her health! I had not yet
started in the direction of ridding myself of the masculine
delusion that woman is a delicate creature by
nature if she happens to be a lady&mdash;and of course I
knew my Edna was a lady through and through. It was
many a year before I learned the truth&mdash;why ladies are
always ailing and why they can do nothing but wear
fine clothes and sit in parlors or in carriages when they
are not sitting at indigestible food, and amuse themselves
and pity themselves for being condemned to live
with coarse, uninteresting American men.</p>

<p>Yes, I was sincere in urging her to take care how
she adopted so laborious a fad as doing her own marketing.
She went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had a carriage it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this sweetly enough and with no suggestion
of reproach. Just the sigh of a lady&#8217;s soul at the hardness
of life&#8217;s conditions. But I, loving her, felt as if
I were somehow to blame. &#8220;You shall have a carriage
before many years,&#8221; said I. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the things
I&#8217;ve been working for.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me a look that made me feel proud I had
her to live for. &#8220;I hope I&#8217;ll be here to enjoy it,&#8221; sighed
she.</p>

<p>I walked sad and silent by her side, profoundly impressed
and depressed by that hint as to her feeble
health. I know now it was sheer pretense with her, the
more easily to manage me and to cover her shortcomings.
I ought to have realized it then. But what man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
does? She certainly did not look ill, for she was not
one of those who were always stuffing themselves at teas
and lunches, and talked of a walk of five blocks as hard
exercise! She had learned how to keep health and
beauty. What intelligence it shows, that she was able
to grasp so difficult a matter; and what splendid persistence
that she was able to carry out a mode of life so
disagreeable to self-indulgence. If her intelligence and
her persistence could have been turned to use! Presently
we were at the butcher shop. I paused in the
doorway while she engaged in her arduous labor. Here
is the conversation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Toomey.&#8221; (Very gracious;
the lady speaking to the trades person.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; (Fat little butcher touching
cracked and broken-nailed hand to hat respectfully.)</p>

<p>&#8220;That lamb you sent yesterday was very tough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, ma&#8217;am. But those kind of things will happen,
you know.&#8221; (Most flatteringly humble of manner.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. Do your best. I&#8217;m sure you try to
please. Send me&mdash;let me see&mdash;say, two chickens for
broiling. You&#8217;ll pick out nice ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ll attend to it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And something for the servants. You know what
they like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ll attend to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll not overcharge, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, ma&#8217;am? I&#8217;ve been dealing with ladies for twenty
years, right here, ma&#8217;am. I never have overcharged.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;I know. All the ladies tell me you&#8217;re honest. I
feel safe with you. Let me see, there were some other
things. But I&#8217;m in a hurry. The cook will tell your
boy when he takes what I&#8217;ve ordered. You&#8217;ll be sure
to give me the best?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d not dare send anything else to <i>you</i>, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
(Groveling.)</p>

<p>A gracious smile, a gracious nod, and Edna rejoined
me. Innocent as I was, and under the spell that
blinds the American man where the American woman
is concerned, I could not but be upset by this example
of how our house was run&mdash;an example that all in an
instant brought to my mind and enabled me to understand
a score, a hundred similar examples. There was
I, toiling away to make money, earning every dollar
by the hardest kind of mental labor, struggling to rise,
to make our fortune, and each day my wife was tossing
carelessly out of the windows into the street a large
part of my earnings. I did not know what to do
about it.</p>

<p>Edna&#8217;s next stop was at the grocer&#8217;s. I had not
the courage to halt and listen. I knew it would be a
repetition of the grotesque interview with the butcher.
And she undoubtedly a clever woman&mdash;alert, improving.
What a mystery! I went on to my office. That day,
without giving my acquaintances there an inkling of
what was in my mind, I made inquiries into how their
wives spent the money that went for food&mdash;the most
important item in the spending of incomes under ten or
twelve thousand a year. In every case the wife or the
mother did the marketing by telephone. All the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
except one took the ignorance and incompetence of the
management of the household expenses as a matter of
course. One man grumbled a little. I remember he
said: &#8220;No wonder it&#8217;s hard for the men to save anything.
The women waste most of it on the table, paying
double prices for poor stuff. I tell you, Loring,
the American woman is responsible for the dishonesty of
American commercial life. They are always nagging
at the man for more and more money to spend, and in
spending it they tempt the merchants, the clerks, their
own servants, everyone within range, to become swindlers
and thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;re a pessimist. The
American woman is all right. Where&#8217;d you find her
equal for intelligence and charm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may be intelligent,&#8221; said he. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t
use it on anything worth while, except roping in some
poor sucker to put up <i>for</i> her and to put up <i>with</i> her.
And she may have charm, but not for a man who has
cut his matrimonial eye teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed at Van Dyck&mdash;that was my grumbling
friend&#8217;s name. And I soon dropped the subject from
my mind. It has never been my habit to waste time in
thinking about things when the thinking could not possibly
lead anywhere. You may say I ought to have
interfered, forced my wife to come to her senses, compelled
her to learn her business. Which shows that
you know little about the nature of the American
woman. If I had taken that course, she would have
hated me, she would have done no better, and she would
have scorned me as a sordid haggler over small sums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of money who was trying to spoil with the vulgarities
of commercial life the beauties of the home. No, I
instinctively knew enough not to interfere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But let us take a long leap forward to the day
when I became president of the railroad, having made
myself a rich man by judicious gambling with eight
thousand dollars loaned me by father Wheatlands. He
was a rich man, and in the way to become very rich,
and he had no heir but Edna after the drowning of
her two brothers under a sailboat in Newark Bay.
Margot was in a fashionable school over in New York.
My wife and I, still a young couple and she beautiful&mdash;my
wife and I were as happy as any married couple
can be where they let each other alone and the husband
gives the wife all the money she wishes and leaves her
free to spend it as she pleases.</p>

<p>When I told her of my good fortune, and the sudden
and large betterment of our finances, she said with
a curious lighting of the eyes, a curious strengthening
of the chin:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;for New York!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New York?&#8221; said I. &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to live in New York,&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we do live in New York. Brooklyn is part
of New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Legally I suppose it is,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;But morally
and &aelig;sthetically, socially, and in every other civilized
way, my dear Godfrey, it is part of the backwoods.
I can hardly wait to get away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Why, I thought you were happy here!&#8221; exclaimed
I, marveling, used though I was to her keeping her own
counsel strictly about the matters that most interested
her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve certainly acted as if you loved it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t <i>mind</i> it at first,&#8221; conceded she. &#8220;But for
two or three years I have <i>loathed</i> it, and everybody that
lives in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was amazed at this last sally. &#8220;Oh, come now,
Edna,&#8221; cried I, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got lots of friends here&mdash;lots
and lots of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was thinking of the dozen or so women whom she
called and who called her by the first name, women she
was with early and late. Women she was daily playing
bridge with&mdash; Bridge! I have a friend who declares
that bridge is ruining the American home, and I see his
point, but I think he doesn&#8217;t look deep enough. If it
weren&#8217;t bridge it would be something else. Bridge is a
striking example, but only a single example, of the
results of feminine folly and idleness that all flow from
the same cause. However, let us go back to my talk
with Edna. She met my protest in behalf of her friends
with a contemptuous:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a soul who isn&#8217;t <i>frightfully</i> common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the same sort of people we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the same sort that <i>I</i> am,&#8221; declared she
proudly. &#8220;And not the sort Margot and you are going
to be. You&#8217;ll see. You don&#8217;t know about these things.
But fortunately I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seriously mean that you want to leave
this splendid old house&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid? It&#8217;s hardly fit to live in. Of course, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
had to endure it while we were poor and obscure. But
now it won&#8217;t do at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And go away from all these people you&#8217;ve worked
so hard to get in with&mdash;all these friends&mdash;go away
among strangers. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t mind. But what would <i>you</i>
do? How&#8217;d you pass the days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These vulgar people bore me to death,&#8221; declared
she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been advancing, if you have stood still.
Thank God, <i>I&#8217;ve</i> got ambition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows they&#8217;ve never been <i>my</i> friends,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;But I must say they seem nice enough people,
as people go. What&#8217;s the matter with &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re common,&#8221; said she with the languor of one
explaining when he feels he will not be understood.
&#8220;They&#8217;re tiresome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit they&#8217;re tiresome,&#8221; said I. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;ve kept away from them. But I doubt if they&#8217;re more
tiresome than people generally. The fact is, my dear,
people are all tiresome. That&#8217;s why they can&#8217;t amuse
themselves or each other, but have to be amused&mdash;have
to hire the clever people of all sorts to entertain them.
Instead of asking people here to bore us and to be bored,
why not send them seats at a theater or orders for a
first-class meal at a first-class restaurant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think that&#8217;s funny,&#8221; said my wife.
She had no sense of humor, and the suggestion of a jest
irritated her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does strike me as funny,&#8221; I admitted.
&#8220;But there&#8217;s sense in it, too.... I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t
want to abandon your friends here. Why make ourselves
uncomfortable all over again?&#8221; I took a serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
persuasive tone. &#8220;Edna, we&#8217;re beginning to get used
to the more stylish way of living we took up when we
left Passaic and came here to live. Is it sensible to
branch out again into the untried and the unknown?
Will we be any wiser or any happier? You can shine
as the big star now in this circle of friends. You like
to run things socially. Here&#8217;s your chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I get any pleasure out of running
things socially in St. Mary&#8217;s?&#8221; demanded she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
outgrown it. It seems vulgar and common to me. It
is vulgar and common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; I asked innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand, I can&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; replied
she tartly. &#8220;Surely you must see that your wife and
your daughter are superior to these people round here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t compare my wife and daughter with other
people,&#8221; said I. &#8220;To me they&#8217;re superior to anybody
and everybody else in the world. I often wish we lived
&#8217;way off in the country somewhere. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d be
happier with only each other. We&#8217;re putting on too
much style to suit me, even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you living in the country,&#8221; laughed she.
&#8220;You&#8217;d come down about once a week or month.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t deny the truth in her accusation. I felt
it ought to have been that my wife and I were so sympathetic,
so interested in the same things, that we were
absorbed in each other. But the facts were against it.
We really had almost nothing in common. I admired
her beauty and also her intelligence and energy, though
I thought them misdirected. She, I think, liked me in
the primitive way of a woman with a man. And she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
admired my ability to make money, though she thought
it rather a low form of intellectual excellence. However,
as she found it extremely useful, she admired me
for it in a way. I have seen much of the aristocratic
temperament that despises money, but I have yet to see
an aristocrat who wasn&#8217;t greedier than the greediest
money-grubber&mdash;and I must say it is hard to conceive
anything lower than the spirit that grabs the gift and
despises the giver. But then, some day, when thinking
is done more clearly, we shall all see that aristocracy
and its spirit is the lowest level of human nature, is
simply a deep-seated survival of barbarism. However,
Edna and I appealed to and satisfied each other in one
way; beyond that our congeniality abruptly ended.
Looking back, I see now that talking <i>with</i> her was never
a pleasure, nor was it a pleasure to her to talk <i>with</i> me.
I irritated her; she bored me.</p>

<p>How rarely in our country do you find a woman
who is an interesting companion for a man, except as
female and male pair or survey the prospect of pairing?
And it matters not what line of activity the man
is taking&mdash;business, politics, literature, art, philanthropy
even. The women are eternally talking about
their superiority to the business man; but do they get
along any better with an artist&mdash;unless he is cultivating
the woman for the sake of an order for a picture? Is
there any line of serious endeavor in which an American
woman is interesting and helpful and companionable to
a man? I can get along very well with an artist. I
have one friend who is a writer of novels, another who
is a writer of plays, a third who is a sculptor. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
are interested in my work, and I in theirs. We talk
together on a basis of equal interest, and we give each
other ideas. Can any American woman say the same?
I don&#8217;t inquire anticipating a negative answer. I simply
put the question. But I suspect the answer would
put a pin in the bubble of the American woman&#8217;s pretense
of superior culture. She is fooled by her vanity,
I fear, and by her sex attraction, and by the influence
of the money her despised father or husband gives her.
There&#8217;s a reason why America is notoriously the land
of bachelor husbands&mdash;and that reason is not the one
the women and foreign fortune hunters assert. The
American man lets the case go by default against him,
not because he couldn&#8217;t answer, nor yet because he is
polite, but <i>because he is indifferent</i>.</p>

<p>But my wife was talking about her projected assault
upon New York. &#8220;I really must be an extraordinary
woman,&#8221; said she. &#8220;How I have fought all these years
to raise myself, with you dragging at me to keep me
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; protested her unhappy husband. &#8220;Why,
dear, I&#8217;ve never opposed you in any way. And I&#8217;ve
tried to do what I could to help you. You must admit
the money&#8217;s been useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve never been mean about money,&#8221; conceded
she. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t sympathize with a single
one of my ideals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to have whatever you want,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;And anything I can do to get it for you, or to help
you get it, I stand ready to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, Godfrey, dear,&#8221; said she, giving me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a long hug and a kiss. &#8220;No woman ever had a more
generous husband than I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>I naturally attached more importance to this burst
of enthusiasm then than I do now. And it is as well
that I was thus simple-minded. How little pleasure we
would get, to be sure, if, when we are praised or loved
by anybody because we do that person a kindness, we
paused to analyze and saw the shallow selfishness of
such praise or such love. After all, it&#8217;s only human
nature to like those who do as we ask them and to dislike
those who don&#8217;t; and I am not quarreling with human
nature&mdash;or with any other of the unchangeable conditions
of the universe. My own love for Edna&mdash;what
was it but the natural result of my getting what I
wanted from her, all I wanted? I really troubled myself
little about her incompetence and extravagance and
craze for social position. No doubt to this day I should
be&mdash; But I am again anticipating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generous? Nonsense,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t generous
to try to make you happy. That&#8217;s my one chance
of being happy myself. A busy man&#8217;s got to have
peace at home. If he hasn&#8217;t he&#8217;s like a soldier attacked
rear and front at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t care where we live,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;And for Margot&#8217;s sake we&#8217;ve simply got to move to
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you want her to stay at home of nights, instead
of living at the school. Why didn&#8217;t you speak of
that first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; cried she. &#8220;How slow you are! No;
for the present, even if we do live in New York, I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
it best for Margot to keep on living at the school. She&#8217;s
barely started there. I want her training to be thorough.
And while I&#8217;m learning as fast as I can, I am
not competent to teach her. I know, of course. But I
haven&#8217;t had the chance to practice. So I can&#8217;t teach
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Teach her what?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be a lady&mdash;a practical, expert lady,&#8221; replied
Edna. &#8220;That&#8217;s what she&#8217;s going to Miss Ryper&#8217;s
school for. And when she comes out she&#8217;ll be the equal
of girls who have generations of culture and breeding
behind them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless me!&#8221; cried I, laughing. &#8220;This Ryper
woman must be a wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; declared Edna. &#8220;It was a great favor,
her letting Margot into the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She couldn&#8217;t do it
until I got two of the directors of the road to insist
on it. But I guess that was merely a bluff of hers to
squeeze us for a few hundreds extra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Edna assured me. &#8220;You are <i>so</i> ignorant,
Godfrey. Please do be careful not to say those
coarse things before people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said I, cheerfully, for I was used
to this kind of calling down. &#8220;All the same, the Ryper
lady is hot for the dough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna shivered. She detested slang&mdash;continued to
detest and avoid it even after she learned that it was
fashionable. &#8220;Miss Ryper guards her list of pupils as
their mothers guard their visiting lists,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But
now she likes Margot. The dear child has been elected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to the most exclusive fraternity. Every girl in it has
to wear hand-made underclothes and has to have had
at least a father, a grandfather, and a great grandfather.&#8221;
Edna laughed with pride at her own cleverness
before she went on. &#8220;Margot came to me when
she was proposed, and cried as if her little heart would
break. She said she didn&#8217;t know anything about her
grandfather and great grandfather. But I hadn&#8217;t forgotten
to arrange that. I think of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was easy enough,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Your grandfather
was a tailor and mine was in the grocery business
like father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna looked round in terror. &#8220;Sh!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Servants always listen.&#8221; She went to the door&mdash;we
were in the small upstairs sitting room&mdash;opened it suddenly,
looked into the hall, closed the door, and returned
to a chair nearer the lounge on which I was stretched
comfortably smoking.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one was there,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I told you
never to speak of&mdash;of those horrible things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Margot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot doesn&#8217;t know. She must <i>never</i> know!
Poor child, she is so sensitive, it would make her ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>I lapsed into gloomy silence. I had not liked the
way Edna had been acting about her parents and mine
ever since we came to Brooklyn. But I had been busy,
and was averse to meddling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave Margot for the benefit of the girls a genealogy
I&#8217;ve gotten up,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;You know all
genealogies are more or less faked, and I&#8217;ve no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
hers is every bit as genuine as those of half the girls
over there. I fixed ours so that it would take a lot of
inquiry to expose it. And Margot got into the fraternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the hand-made underclothes fake too?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. <i>They</i> had to be genuine. I&#8217;ve never let
Margot wear any other kind since I learned about those
things. There&#8217;s nothing that gives a child such a sense
of ladylikeness and superiority as to feel she&#8217;s dressed
right from the skin out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, school&#8217;s a different sort of a place from what
it was in our day,&#8221; said I. The picture my wife had
drawn amused me, but I somehow did not exactly like it.
My mind was too little interested in the direction of the
things that absorbed Edna for me to be able to put into
any sort of shape the thoughts vaguely moving about
in the shadows. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;poor Margot
doesn&#8217;t have as good a time as we had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d hate that kind of a time,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>I laughed and laid my hand in her lap. Her hand
stole into it. I watched her lovely face&mdash;the sweet,
dreamy expression. &#8220;What are you thinking?&#8221; said I
softly, hopeful of romance&mdash;what <i>I</i> call romance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking how low and awful we used to be,&#8221;
replied she, &#8220;and how splendidly we are getting away
from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed, for I was used to cold water on my romance.
&#8220;All the same,&#8221; insisted I, &#8220;Margot would
envy us if she knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d hate it,&#8221; Edna repeated. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to
be an improvement on <i>us</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Not on you,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>She looked at me with tender sparkling eyes, the
same lovely light-brown eyes that had fascinated me as
a boy. Brown eyes for a woman, always! But they
must not be of the heavy commonplace shades of brown
like a deer&#8217;s or a cow&#8217;s. They must have light shades
in them, tints verging toward blue or green. Said
Edna: &#8220;I&#8217;m doing my best to fit myself. And before I
get through, Godfrey, I think I&#8217;ll go far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you will,&#8221; said I, with no disposition to turn
the cold douche on <i>her</i> kind of romance. What an idiot
I was about her, to be sure! I went on: &#8220;And I&#8217;ll see
that you have the money to grease the toboggan slide
and make the going easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She talked on happily and confidingly: &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s
best to leave Margot another year as a boarder at Miss
Ryper&#8217;s. By that time we&#8217;ll be established over in New
York, and we&#8217;ll have a proper place for her to receive
her friends. And perhaps we&#8217;ll have a few friends of
our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swell friends, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say swell, dear,&#8221; corrected she. &#8220;It&#8217;s
such a common word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard <i>you</i> say it,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t any more. I&#8217;ve learned better. And
now I&#8217;ve taught you better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything you like. Anybody you like,&#8221; said I.
When Edna and I were together, with our hands clasped,
I was always completely under her spell. She could do
what she pleased with me, so long, of course, as she
didn&#8217;t interfere in my end of the firm. And I may add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
that she never did; she hadn&#8217;t the faintest notion what
I was about. They say there are thousands of American
women in the cities who know their husbands&#8217; places
of business only as street and telephone numbers. My
wife was one of that kind. Oh, yes, from the standpoint
of those who insist that business and home should be
separate, we were a model couple.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another matter I want to talk over with
you, Godfrey,&#8221; she went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lovely dress you&#8217;re wearing,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;It goes so well with your skin and your hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was delighted, and was moved to rise and look
at herself in the long mirror. She gave herself an approving
glance, but not more approving than what she
saw merited. A long, slim beautiful figure; a dress that
set it off. A lovely young tip-tilted face, the face of a
girl with fresh, clear eyes and skin, the whitest, evenest
sharp teeth&mdash;and such hair!&mdash;such quantities of hair
attractively arranged.</p>

<p>From herself she glanced at me. &#8220;No one&#8217;d ever
think what we came from, would they?&#8221; said she fondly
and proudly. &#8220;Oh, Godfrey, it makes me so happy
that we <i>look</i> the part. We belong where we&#8217;re going.
The good blood away back in the family is coming out.
And Margot&mdash; I&#8217;ve always called her the little duchess&mdash;and
she looks it and feels it.&#8221; Dreamily, &#8220;Maybe
she will be some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she&#8217;s a baby,&#8221; cried I. For I didn&#8217;t like to
see that my baby was growing up.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s nearly fourteen,&#8221; said Edna. She was looking
at herself again. &#8220;Would you ever think <i>I</i> had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
daughter fourteen years old?&#8221; said she, making a
laughing, saucy face at me.</p>

<p>I got up and kissed her. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look as old
as you did when I married you,&#8221; said I, and it was only a
slight exaggeration.</p>

<p>When we sat again, she was snuggled into my lap
with her head against my shoulder. She was immensely
fond of being petted. They say this is no sign of a
loving nature, that cats, the least loving of all pets, are
fondest of petting. I have no opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it you wanted to talk about?&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; laughed she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I supposed so, as that&#8217;s the only matter in which
I have any influence in this family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to think of it,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it <i>is</i> money&mdash;in
a way. It&#8217;s about&mdash;our parents.&#8221; She gave a deep
sigh. &#8220;Godfrey, they hang over me like a nightmare!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tragic seriousness amused me. &#8220;Oh, cheer up,&#8221;
said I, kissing her. &#8220;They certainly don&#8217;t fit in with
our stylishness. But they&#8217;re away off there in Passaic,
and bother us as little as we bother them. The truth
is, Edna, we&#8217;ve not acted right. We&#8217;ve been selfish&mdash;spending
all our prosperity on ourselves. Of course,
they&#8217;ve got everything they really want, but&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly it,&#8221; said she eagerly. &#8220;My conscience
has been hurting me. We ought to&mdash;to&mdash; It
wouldn&#8217;t cost much to make them perfectly comfortable&mdash;so
they&#8217;d not have to work&mdash;and could get away
from the grocery&mdash;and the&mdash;and the&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated
before saying &#8220;father&#8217;s business,&#8221; as if nerving herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to pronounce words of shame. And when she did
finally force out the evading &#8220;father&#8217;s business,&#8221; it
was with such an accent that I couldn&#8217;t help laughing
outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undertaking&#8217;s a good-paying business,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;We certainly ought to be grateful to it. It supplied
the eight thousand dollars that gave me the chance to
buy half the rolling mill. And you know the rolling
mill was the start of our fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think father could be induced to retire?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Your father&#8217;s a rich man, for
Passaic. He&#8217;s got two hundred thousand at least hived
away in tenements that pay from twenty to thirty-five
per cent. And his business now brings in ten to fifteen
thousand a year straight along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make <i>your</i> father retire?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;Poor dad! I&#8217;ve been keeping him from
being retired by the sheriff. He&#8217;s squeezing out a bare
living. He&#8217;d be delighted to stop and have all his time
for talking politics and religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could buy them a nice place a little way out
in the country, on some quiet road. I&#8217;m sure your
mother and your old maid sister would love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said I. &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t <i>too</i> quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it must be quiet. And we&#8217;ll induce my father
and mother to buy a place near by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;ll not give up the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought it all out,&#8221; said Edna, whose mind
was equal to whatever task she gave it. &#8220;You must
get some one to offer him a price he simply can&#8217;t refuse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and make a condition that he shall not go into business
again. Aren&#8217;t those things done?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was somewhat surprised, but not much, at the
knowledge of business this displayed. &#8220;Why!&mdash;Why!&#8221;
laughed I. &#8220;And you pretend to know nothing about
business!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in a sensible, loving mood that day. So she
said with a quiet little laugh: &#8220;I make it a point to
know anything that&#8217;s useful to me. I don&#8217;t know much
about business. Why should I bother with it? I&#8217;ve
got confidence in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not the first time I had got a peep into her
mind and had seen how she looked on everyone, including
me, as a wheel in her machine, and never interfered
unless the wheel didn&#8217;t work to suit her. I laughed
delightedly. There was something charmingly feminine,
thought I, about this point of view so upside down.
&#8220;Yes, I guess your father&#8217;ll jump for the bait you
suggest,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But why disturb him? He loves
his undertaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll be miserable idling about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess he&#8217;ll get along all right,&#8221; said she,
with sarcasm and with truth. &#8220;He&#8217;ll devote himself to
suing his tenants and counting his money.... Godfrey,
you simply must get those people in Passaic out
of our way. I&#8217;ve been a little nervous over here, though
I knew that none of these dreadful people we associate
with has anything better in the way of family than us,
and some have a lot worse. Oh, it&#8217;s <i>frightful</i> to have
parents one&#8217;s ashamed of!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>I think I blushed. I&#8217;m sure I looked away to avoid
seeing her expression. &#8220;It&#8217;s frightful to be ashamed
of one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t be hypocritical,&#8221; cried she. &#8220;You
know perfectly well you are ashamed of your parents,
as I am of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that if they showed up at the
office, I&#8217;d be a bit upset and would feel apologetic.
But I&#8217;m ashamed of myself for feeling that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you only realized about things,&#8221; said she, which
was her phrase for hitting at me as lacking in refined
instincts, &#8220;you&#8217;d not be ashamed of yourself, but would
frankly suffer. They are a disgrace to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re honest people, well meaning, and as good
as the best in every essential way,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Believe
me, Edna, the fault isn&#8217;t in them. It&#8217;s in us. Suppose
you found some day that Margot was ashamed of you
and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;ll not be,&#8221; retorted Edna. &#8220;I for one will
see to it that she has no cause to be anything but
proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t but admit that there were two sides to
the problem of our parents. It was shameful to be
ashamed of them. But it was also human. I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;and
can&#8217;t&mdash;utterly damn in Edna a fault, a vulgar
weakness, I myself had, and almost everyone I knew.
No doubt, gentle reader, you are scandalized and disgusted.
But one of my objects in relating this whole
story is to scandalize and to disgust you. You have
had too much consideration at the hands of writers&mdash;you
and your hypocritical virtues and your hysterical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
nerves. If you are an American, you are probably far
in advance of your parents in worldly knowledge, in
education, in every way except perhaps manly and
womanly self-respect. For along with your progress
has come an infection of snobbishness and toadyism
that seems in some mysterious way inseparable from
higher civilization. So be shocked and disgusted with
Edna and me, and don&#8217;t turn your hypocritical eyes
inward on your own secret thoughts and actions about
your own humble parents. Above all, don&#8217;t learn from
this horrifying episode a decenter mode of thinking and
feeling&mdash;<i>and</i> acting.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get them out of the way before we move
to New York,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;Ever since Margot began
at Mrs. Ryper&#8217;s I&#8217;ve been on pins and needles. You
don&#8217;t know how malicious fashionable people are. Why,
some of them who have nothing to do might at any time
run out to Passaic and see for themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna was sitting up in my lap, gazing at me with
wide harassed-looking eyes. I burst out laughing.
&#8220;They might take a camera along, and get some snapshots,&#8221;
I suggested.</p>

<p>Edna&#8217;s face contracted with horror and her form
grew limp and weak. &#8220;My God!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;So
they might. Godfrey, we must attend to it at once.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> never been able to come to a satisfactory
verdict as to the intelligence of the human race. Is it
stupid, or is it, rather, sluggish? Is it unable to think,
or does it refuse to think? Does it believe the follies
it pretends to believe and usually acts upon, or is it
the victim of its own willful prejudices and hypocrisies?
Never have I decided that a certain man or woman was
practically witless, but that he or she has confounded
me by saying or doing something indicating shrewdness
or even wisdom.</p>

<p>The women are especially difficult to judge. Take
Edna, for example.</p>

<p>It was impossible to interest her in anything worth
while. But as to the things in which she was interested,
none could have thought more clearly or keenly,
or could have acted with more vigor and effect. I have
often made serious blunders&mdash;inexcusable blunders&mdash;in
managing my own affairs. To go no further, my
management of my family would have convicted me of
imbecility before any court not made up of good-natured,
indifferent, woman-worshiping, woman-despising
American husbands. Yes, I have made the stupidest
blunders in all creation. But I cannot recall a single
notable blunder made by Edna in the matters which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
alone she deemed worthy of her attention. She decided
what she wanted. She moved upon it by the best route,
whether devious or direct or a combination of the two.
And she always got it.</p>

<p>You may say her success was due to the fact that
her objects were trivial. But if you will think a moment,
you will appreciate that a thing&#8217;s triviality does
not necessarily make it easy to attain. As much energy
and skill may be shown in winning a sham battle as in
winning a real. Still, I suppose minds are cast in molds
of various sizes, and one cast in a small mold can deal
only with the small. And I guess that, from whatever
cause, the minds of women are of diverse kinds of smaller
molds. Perhaps this is the result of bad education.
Perhaps better education will correct it. I do not
know. I can speak only of what is&mdash;of Edna as she is
and always has been.</p>

<p>Having made up her mind to fell the genealogical
tree, that an artificial one might be stood up in its place,
she lost no time in getting into action.</p>

<p>It was on the Sunday following our talk&mdash;the earliest
possible day&mdash;that she took me for the first visit
we had made our parents in nearly three years. We had
sent them presents. We had written them letters. We
had received painfully composed and ungrammatical replies&mdash;these
received both for Edna and myself at my
office, because she feared the servants would pry into
periodically arriving exhibits of illiteracy. We had
written them of coming and bringing Margot with us.
We had received suggestions of their coming to see us,
which Edna had evaded by such excuses as that we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
moving or that she or Margot was not well or that the
cook had abruptly deserted. The world outside Passaic
was a vague place to our old fathers and mothers. Their
own immediate affairs kept them busy. So with no sense
of deliberate alienation on their side and small and
mildly intermittent sense of it on our side, the months
and the years passed without our seeing one another.</p>

<p>Edna announced to me the intended visit only an
hour before we started. It was a habit of hers&mdash;a
clever habit, too&mdash;never to take anyone into her confidence
about her plans until the right moment&mdash;that is,
the moment when execution was so near at hand that
discussion would seem futile. At a quarter before nine
on that Sunday morning she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dress for church. This is a good day to
make that trip to Passaic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go by Miss Ryper&#8217;s for Margot,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;How the old people will stare when they see her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna looked at me as if I had suddenly uncovered
unmistakable evidence of my insanity. Then I who had
clean forgot her foolish notions remembered. &#8220;But
why not?&#8221; I urged. &#8220;It will give them so much
pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trash!&#8221; ejaculated she. &#8220;They don&#8217;t care a rap
about her. They can&#8217;t, as they&#8217;ve not seen her since
she was a baby. And Margot would suffer horribly.
I think it would be wicked to give a sweet, happy young
girl a horrible shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>This grotesque view of the effect of the sight of
grandparents upon a grandchild struck me as amusing.
But there was no echo of my laughter in the disgusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
face of my wife. I sobered and said: &#8220;Yes, it would
give her a shock. We&#8217;ve made a mistake, bringing her
up in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late to discuss it now,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; I could not but agree. &#8220;I guess the
mischief&#8217;s done beyond repair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Edna: &#8220;Have you any sense of&mdash;of them being
<i>your</i> father and mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; said I. &#8220;My childhood is very vivid to
me, and not at all disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me like a bad dream&mdash;unreal, and to
be forgotten as quickly as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this with a fine, spiritual look in her eyes,
and I must say that Edna, refined, delicately beautiful,
fashionably dressed, speaking her English with an elegant
accent, did not suggest fusty-dusty, queer-looking
Weeping Willie with his hearse and funeral coaches, his
embalming apparatus and general appearance of animated
casket, nor yet fat, sloppy Ma Wheatlands, always
in faded wrappers and with holes cut in her shoes
for her bunions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wear your oldest business suit,&#8221; said Edna, coming
back to earth from the contemplation of her own
elevation and grandeur. &#8220;I shall dress as quietly as I
dare. We mustn&#8217;t arouse the suspicions of the servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna&#8217;s fooleries amused me. I didn&#8217;t then appreciate
the dangers of tolerating and laughing at the bad
habits of a fascinating child. If I had, little good I&#8217;d
have accomplished, I suspect. However, I got myself
up as Edna directed, and when I saw how it irritated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
her I stopped making such remarks as: &#8220;Shall I wear
a collar? Hadn&#8217;t I better sneak out the back way and
join you at the ferry?&#8221; I should have liked to get
some fun out of our doings; that would have taken at
least the saw edge off my feelings of self-contempt. I
am not fond of hypocrisy, yet for that one occasion I
should have welcomed the familiar human shamming and
faking in such matters. But Edna would put the thing
through like one of her father&#8217;s funerals. As we, in
what was practically disguise, issued forth, she said
loudly enough for the cocking ear of a maid who chanced
to be in the front hall:</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, the country dust won&#8217;t spoil these
clothes. I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s clear. How charming the
woods will look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just enough to deceive. Edna expanded upon her
cleverness in never saying too much, because saying too
much always started people, especially servants, to
thinking. But she abruptly checked her flow of self-praise
as we seated ourselves in the ferry and she looked
about. There, not a dozen seats away, loomed our
cook! Yes, no mistake, it was our Mary, &#8220;gotten up
regardless&#8221; for a Sunday outing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see Mary?&#8221; said my wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the most conspicuous female in sight,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;She&#8217;s a credit to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have been mad,&#8221; groaned Edna, &#8220;to give
her a holiday! Always the way. I never do a generous,
kind-hearted thing that I don&#8217;t have to pay for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t follow you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;She hates us,&#8221; explained Edna. &#8220;Cooks&mdash;Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
cooks&mdash;invariably hate the families they draw wages
from. She&#8217;s dogging us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She probably hasn&#8217;t even
seen us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Edna was not listening; she was contriving.
&#8220;We must let her leave the boat ahead of us. Pretend
not to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I obeyed orders. In the Jersey City train shed we,
lagging behind, saw her take a train bound for a different
destination from ours. Much relieved, Edna led
the way to the Passaic train. Hardly were we seated
when in at the door of the coach hurried our Mary,
excited and blown. She came beaming down the aisle.
Edna saluted her graciously and calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got in the wrong train,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;It&#8217;d
never have took me nowheres near my cousin in
Passaic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna&#8217;s composure was admirable. Said I, when
Mary had passed on, &#8220;Now what, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see she <i>is</i> dogging us,&#8221; replied Edna. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
not a doubt she knows all about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>think</i> she&#8217;s got a camera,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Still,
they make them very small nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to go on in the train, and return
home from the station beyond,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as you like,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But as for me, I get
off at Passaic and go to see the old folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please stop your joking,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;If you
had any pride you couldn&#8217;t joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am serious,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I shall go to see mother
and father.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;No doubt her cousin lives in the same part of the
slums,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;Oh, it is <i>hideous</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what possessed me&mdash;whether a fit of
indigestion and obstinacy or a sudden access of sense
of decency as I approached my old home. Whatever
it was, it moved me to say: &#8220;My dear, this nonsense
has gone far enough. We will do what we set out
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll drop off at Passaic alone, and hire a
trap, and give Mary a seat in it as far as her cousin&#8217;s.
I&#8217;m not proud of my parents, the more shame to me.
But there&#8217;s a limit to my ability to degrade myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna and I had not lived together all those years
without her learning the tone I use when I will not be
trifled with. She did not argue. She sat silent and pale
beside me. When the train stopped at Passaic she followed
me from the car. Mary descended ahead of us
and moved off at as brisk a pace as tight corsets and
stiff new shoes would permit, in a direction exactly opposite
that we were to take.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad we didn&#8217;t go on?&#8221; said I, eager
to make it up.</p>

<p>She made no reply. She maintained haughty and
injured silence until we were within sight of the houses.
Then she said curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the talking about our plans for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be best,&#8221; said I, most conciliatory.</p>

<p>I had not intended to say this. There had been a
half-formed resolution in my mind to oppose those plans.
But her anger roused in me such a desire to pacify her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
that I promptly yielded, where, I must in honesty confess,
I was little short of indifferent. American husbands
have the reputation of being the most docile and
the worst henpecked men in the world. All foreigners
say so, and our women believe it. In fact, nothing
could be further from the truth. The docility of American
husbands is the good nature of indifference. A
friend of mine has the habit of saying that his most
valued and most valuable possession is his long list of
things he cares not a rap about. It is a typically
American and luminous remark. The men of other
nations agitate over trifles, love to have the sense of
being master at home&mdash;usually their one and only
chance for a free swing at the joyous feeling of being
boss. The American man, absorbed in his important
work at office or factory, and not caring especially
about anything else, lets thieving politicians rule in
public affairs, lets foolish, incompetent women rule
in domestic affairs. He has a half-conscious philosophy
that he is shrewd enough, if he attends to his
business, to make money faster than they can take it
away from him, and that, if he does not attend to his
business only, he will have nothing either for thieving
politician and spendthrift wife or for himself. If you
wish to discover how little there is in the notion of his
docility, meddle with something he really cares about.
Many a political rascal, many a shiftless wife, has done
it and has gotten a highly disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>Perhaps what I saw had as much to do with my
tame acquiescence in my wife&#8217;s projects as my desire
to have peace between her and me, when peace meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
yielding what only a vague and feeble filial impulse
moved me to contest. I had what I thought was a clear
and vivid memory of my natal place and Edna&#8217;s&mdash;how
the two houses looked, how small and shabby they were,
how mean their surroundings, how plain their interiors.
But as we drove up I discovered that memory had been
pleasantly deceiving me. Could these squalid hovels,
these tiny, hideous boxes set in two dismal weedy oblongs
of unkempt yards&mdash;could these be our old homes? And
the bent old laboring man and his wife&mdash;we had drawn
up in front of my home&mdash;could they be <i>my</i> father and
<i>my</i> mother?</p>

<p>A feeling of sickness, of nausea came over me. Not
from repulsion for my parents&mdash;thank God, I had not
sunk that low. But from abhorrence of myself, so degraded
by the &#8220;higher world&#8221; into which prosperity
and Edna&#8217;s ambitions had dragged me that I could
look down upon the gentle old man and the patient, loving
old woman to whom I owed life and a fair start in
the world. My blood burned and my eyes sank as they
greeted me, their homely old hands trembling, their
mouths distorted by emotion and age and missing teeth.
I turned away while they were kissing Edna, for I felt
I should hate her and loathe myself if I saw the expression
that must be in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are my father and mother!&#8221; she cried in a
suffocating voice. And we three Lorings were watching
her hurry across the yard and through the gap in the
fence between the two places. My sister came forward.
We kissed each other as awkwardly as two strangers. I
looked at her dazedly. Mary, our cook, was an imposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
looking lady beside this thin-haired, coarse-featured
old maid. In embarrassed silence we four entered the
house. I am not tall nor in the least fat, yet I had an
uncontrollable impulse to stoop and to squeeze as I
entered the squat and narrow doorway. That miserable
little &#8220;parlor!&#8221;</p>

<p>As we sat silent my roving glance at last sought my
mother&#8217;s face. Oh, the faces, the masks, with which
freakish and so often savagely ironic fate covers and
hides our souls, making fair seem foul and foul seem
fair, making beauty repellent and ugliness seem beautiful.
Suddenly through that plain, time- and toil-scarred
mask, through those dim, sunken eyes, I saw
her soul&mdash;her mother&#8217;s heart&mdash;looking at me. And the
tears poured into my eyes. &#8220;Mother!&#8221; I sobbed in a
choking voice, and I put my arms round her and nestled
against her heart, a boy again&mdash;a bad boy with a streak
of good in him. I felt how proud she&mdash;they all&mdash;were
of me, the son and brother, who had gone forth and fulfilled
the universal American dream of getting up in
the world. I hoped, I prayed that they would not realize
what a poor creature I was, with my snobbish
shame.</p>

<p>There was an awkward, rambling attempt at talk.
But we had nothing to talk about&mdash;nothing in common.
I happened to think of our not having brought Margot;
how shameful it was, yet how glad I felt, and how self-contemptuous
for being glad. To break that awful
silence I enlarged upon Margot&mdash;her beauty, her cleverness.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must be like Polly&#8221;&mdash;my sister&#8217;s name was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Polly&mdash;&#8220;like Polly was at her age,&#8221; observed my
mother.</p>

<p>I looked at Polly Ann, in whose faded face and
withered form&mdash;faded and withered though she was not
yet forty, was in fact but seven or eight years older than
I. Like Polly! I could speak no more of Margot, the
delicate loveliness of a rare, carefully reared hot-house
exotic. Yes, exotic; for the girls and the women
brought up in the super-refinements of prosperous class
silliness seem foreign to this world&mdash;and are.</p>

<p>A few minutes that seemed hours, and Edna came
in, her father and mother limping and hobbling in her
train. Edna was sickly pale and her eyelids refused to
rise. I shook hands with old Willie Wheatlands, hesitated,
then kissed the fat, sallow, swinging cheek of my
mother-in-law. Said Edna in a hard, forced voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve explained that Margot isn&#8217;t well and that
we&#8217;ve got to get back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy me!&#8221; cried my mother. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you going
to stay to supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>Supper! It was only half-past twelve. Supper
could not be until five or half-past. We had been there
half an hour and already conversation was exhausted
and time had become motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;We intended to,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;But Margot wasn&#8217;t
at all well when we left. We simply can&#8217;t stay away
long. We&#8217;d not have come, but we felt we&#8217;d never get
here if we kept on letting things interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t leave Margy <i>alone</i>?&#8221; demanded Edna&#8217;s
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;Only a&mdash;a servant.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;Oh, you keep a nurse girl, too,&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;I
thought Edna didn&#8217;t look as if she did any of her own
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have a&mdash;a girl, in addition to the cook,&#8221;
replied Edna, flushing as she thus denied three of her
five servants&mdash;flushing not because of the denial, but
because in her confession she had almost forgotten
about the numerous excuses based on the cook. &#8220;Godfrey
has been doing very well, and we felt we could
afford it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get rid of her,&#8221; advised old Willie sourly.
&#8220;And of the cook, too. Servant girls is mighty wasteful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;ll teach Margy badness,&#8221; said my mother.
&#8220;Them servants is full of poison. Even if yer pa&#8217;d had
money I&#8217;d never have allowed no servant round my children,
no more&#8217;n a snake in the cradle. I hope she&#8217;s a
good Christian, and not a Catholic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right,&#8221; declared Edna nervously. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ll have to be going soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that there girl might git drunk,&#8221; said Mrs.
Wheatlands.</p>

<p>&#8220;And set fire to the house maybe,&#8221; said my mother.
&#8220;I heard of a case just last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you hadn&#8217;t said that,&#8221; cried Edna, her tones
of protest more like jubilation. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be wretched until
I&#8217;m home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother told in detail and with rising excitement the
story of the drunken nurse girl who had burned up herself
and her charges, a pair of lovely twins. From that
moment our families were anxious for us to go. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
three women could see the girl drunk and the house
burning. The two grandfathers, while less imaginative,
were almost as uneasy. Besides, no doubt our families
found us full as tiring as we found them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But before we go,&#8221; said Edna, in a business-like
tone, &#8220;there&#8217;s one thing we wanted to talk about. Godfrey
has had&mdash;that is, he has done very well in business.
And of course our first thought&mdash;one of our first
thoughts&mdash;was what could we do for you all down here.
We hate to think of your living in this unhealthful part
of the town. We want to see you settled in some healthful
place, up in the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were watching the faces of our five kinsfolk.
We could make nothing of their expression. It was
heavy, dull&mdash;mere listening, without a hint of even comprehension
behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought you, father, and Mr.&mdash;father Loring&mdash;might
look round and find a nice farm with a big
comfortable house&mdash;plenty big enough for you all&mdash;and
Godfrey will buy it, and will pay for a man and a woman
to look after you. He has done well, as I said, and he
can afford it. In fact, they&#8217;ve made him president of
the railroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father, my mother, and my sister exchanged
glances. A long, awed silence. Old Willie spoke in his
squeaky, stingy voice: &#8220;I can&#8217;t leave my business. I
ain&#8217;t footless like Loring there. <i>My</i> business pays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can sell it,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;You know you
ought to retire. You were telling me how bad your
health had been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody else couldn&#8217;t make nothing like what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
make out of it. The men growing up nowadays ain&#8217;t no
account. The no-account women with heads full of foolishness
leads &#8217;em off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna agreed with him, pointed out that he&#8217;d have
to give up soon anyhow, appealed to his cupidity for
real estate by expanding upon the size and value of the
farm I was willing to give him. She made a strong impression.
The women were converted by the prospect
of having help with the work. My father had long
dreamed of a home in the country. He had not the
imagination to picture how he would be bored, away
from the loafers with whom he talked politics and religion.
&#8220;And,&#8221; said Edna, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have horses and
things to ride in, so you can go where you please whenever
you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had roused them. We had dazzled them. It
was plain that if a purchaser could be found for the
Wheatlands undertaking business, Edna would carry her
point. &#8220;Godfrey will look for somebody to take the
business,&#8221; said she to her father. &#8220;I want you and
Father Loring to start out to-morrow morning, and not
stop till you&#8217;ve found a farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood an uncertain gleam in old Willie&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;About the price,&#8221; said I, speaking for the first time,
&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to pay twenty-five thousand down for the
place alone, and as I&#8217;ll pay cash, you ought to be able
on mortgage to get a farm&mdash;or two or three adjoining
farms&mdash;that would cost twice that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two families were dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I can trust you, Mr. Wheatlands, to get
the money&#8217;s worth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;Buy a big place,&#8221; said Edna, of the unexpected
timely shrewdnesses. &#8220;Go back from the main roads
where land&#8217;s so dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wheatlands nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty of roads after a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna was ready to depart. &#8220;Then it&#8217;s settled?&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>Her father nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to see what can
be done. But I&#8217;d rather not have Ben Loring along.
He&#8217;d interfere with a good bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you go alone, Willie,&#8221; said my father.
&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;ve got to &#8217;tend store. I can&#8217;t afford a
boy any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mention of the, to them, enormous sum of money
had put them in a state of awe as to Edna and me. It
saddened me to observe how quickly the weed of snobbishness,
whose seeds are in all human nature, sprang up
and dominated the whole garden. They lost the sense
of our blood kinship with them. They felt that we, able
to dispense such splendid largess, were of a superior
order of being. And I saw that my and Edna&#8217;s feeling
of strangeness toward them was intimacy beside the
feeling of strangeness toward us which they now had.
In my dealings with my fellow beings I have often noted
this sort of thing&mdash;that the snobbishness of those who
look down is a weak and hesitating impulse which would
soon die out but for the encouragement it gets from the
snobbishness of those who look up. I read somewhere,
&#8220;Caste is made by those who look up, not by those who
look down.&#8221; That is a great truth, and like most great,
simple, obvious truths is usually overlooked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Looking back I see that my own first decisive impulse
toward the caste feeling came that day, came when my
people and Edna&#8217;s, discovering that we were rich, began
to treat us as lower class treats upper class.</p>

<p>My mother had been scrutinizing me for signs of
the majesty of wealth. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wear a beard,
or leastways a mustache, Godfrey?&#8221; she finally inquired.
&#8220;Then you wouldn&#8217;t seem so boyish like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to wear a mustache,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but I cut it
off because&mdash;I don&#8217;t recall why.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact I did recall. I noted one day that I had a
good mouth and better teeth than most men have. And
it came to me how absurd it was to hang a bunch of
hair from my upper lip to trail in the soup and to
embalm the odors of past cigars for the discomfort of
my nose. Edna kept after me for a time to let it grow
again. But reading in some novel she regarded as
authoritative that mustaches were &#8220;common,&#8221; she desisted.
And I found my boyish appearance highly useful.
It led men to underestimate me&mdash;a signal advantage
in the contests of wit against wit in which I daily
engaged with a view to wrenching a fortune for myself
away from my fellow men.</p>

<p>My mother went on to urge me to make my face
look older and more formidable. Now that she had
learned what a grand person I was she feared others
would not realize it. Edna, who, as I have said, was
shrewdness personified where her own interests were involved,
immediately saw the dangerous bearings of this
newly aroused vanity of our kin. &#8220;I forgot to caution
you,&#8221; said she, &#8220;not to mention our prosperity. If we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
were talked about now, it might be lost entirely. The
only reason Godfrey and I came to you so soon with
the news of it was because we wanted to do something
for you right away. And we knew we could trust you
not to get us into trouble. Don&#8217;t talk about us. If
you hear people talking, if they ask you questions, pretend
you don&#8217;t understand and don&#8217;t know. You see,
it may be spies from our enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>One glance round that circle of eager faces was
enough to convince that Edna had made precisely the
impression she desired. I could see that my mother
and old Weeping Willie, the shrewd of the five&mdash;the two
to whom Edna and I owed most by inheritance&mdash;were
prepared to deny knowing us if that would aid in safeguarding
the precious prosperity. My father and sister
were obviously disappointed that they could not go
about boasting of our magnificence and getting from
the neighbors the envy and respect due the near relations
of a plutocrat. But there was no danger of their
being indiscreet; Edna could breathe freely. And when
the two families were tucked away in the midst of a
large and secluded farm, she could tell what genealogical
stories she pleased without fear of being confounded by
the truth.</p>

<p>By three o&#8217;clock we were back in Brooklyn. Edna
felt and looked triumphant. The crowning of the day&#8217;s
work had been small but significant. A heavy rain
storm that came up while we were on the way back
must have made the servants think we had cut short
our woodland outing. As we were going to bed that
might Edna roused herself from deep study and broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
a long silence with, &#8220;I hesitated whether to tell them
you had become president of the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had noted that seeming slip of hers, so unlike her
cautious reticence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I remembered they&#8217;d be sure to see it in the
papers,&#8221; continued she. &#8220;And I decided it was best to
tell and quiet them.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the old folks were industriously settling themselves
in the New Jersey woods&mdash; Here let me relieve
my mind by saying a few words in mitigation of the
unfilial and snobbish conduct of Edna and me. I admit
we deserve nothing but condemnation. I admit I am
more to blame than she because I could have compelled
her to act better toward our families, though of course
I could not have changed her feelings&mdash;or my own, for
that matter. But, as often happens in this world, the
thing that was in motive shameful turned out well.
We and our families had grown hopelessly apart. Intercourse
with them could not but have been embarrassing
and uncomfortable for both sides. When we got them
the farm, got them away from the malarial and squalid
part of Passaic into a healthful region where they lived
in much better health and in a comfort they could appreciate,
we did the best possible thing for them, as well
as for ourselves. Do not think for a moment that because
I am ashamed of my snobbish motives I am therefore
advocating the keeping up of irksome and absurd
ties merely out of wormy sentimentality. It
has always seemed to me, when we have but the one
chance at life, the one chance to make the best of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
talents and opportunities, that only moral or mental
weakness, or both, would waste the one chance in the
bondage of outworn ties. When one has outgrown any
association, lop it off relentlessly, say I. If the living
lets the dying cling to it, the dying does not live but
the living dies. If you are associated with anyone in
any way&mdash;business, social, ties of affection, whatever
you please&mdash;and if you do not wish to lose that one,
then keep yourself alive and abreast of him or her.
And if you let yourself begin to decay and find yourself
cut away, whose is the fault, if fault there be? We&mdash;Edna
and I&mdash;perhaps did not do all we might to make
our outgrown families happy; I say perhaps, though
I am by no means sure that we did not do all that was
in our power, for they certainly would have got no
pleasure out of seeing more of two people so uncongenial
to them in every respect. At any rate, we did
not leave our families to starve or to suffer. Hard
though my charming, lovely wife was, I cannot conceive
her sinking to that depth. On the whole, I feel that
we could honestly say we took the right course with
them. That is, we helped them without hindering ourselves.
We did the right thing, though not in the right
way.</p>

<p>While our families were choosing a farm, were fixing
up the buildings to suit their needs and tastes, were
moving themselves from their ancient haunts, Edna was
as industriously busy making far deeper inroads on
the new prosperity. She was planning the conquest of
New York.</p>

<p>Every day in the year many a suddenly enriched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
family is busy about the same enterprise. Families from
the less fashionable parts of the city moving to the
fashionable parts. Families from other cities and towns&mdash;east,
west, north, and south&mdash;advancing to social conquest
under the leadership of mammas and daughters
tired of shining in obscure, monotonous, and unappreciative
places. There are I forget how many thousands
of millionaires on Manhattan Island; enough, I know,
with the near millionaires and those living like millionaires,
to make a city of three or four hundred thousand,
not including servants and parasites. Not all of these
have the fashionable craze; at least, they haven&#8217;t it in
its worst form&mdash;the form in which it possessed my wife.
All the acute sufferers must find suitable lodgments near
Fifth Avenue if not in it.</p>

<p>Now New York is ever ready to receive and to
&#8220;trim&#8221; the arriving millionaire. It has all kinds of
houses and apartments to meet the peculiarities of his&mdash;or,
rather, of his wife&#8217;s and daughter&#8217;s&mdash;notions of
grandeur. It has a multitude of purveyors of furnishings
and decorations likewise designed to catch crude
and grandiose tastes. My wife was busy with these
gentry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better go a little slow?&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Why not live in a hotel on Manhattan and look
about us?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had respect for my wife&#8217;s capacity at the woman
side of the game; she had thoroughly drilled me to more
than generous appreciation of it. But at the same time
I was not so blinded by her charm for me or so convinced
by her insistent and plausible egotism that I had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
noted certain minor failures of hers due to her ignorance
of the art of spending money. She was clever at learning.
But often her vanity lured her into fancying she
knew, when in fact her education in that particular direction
was all miseducation. She dressed much more
giddily in our first years in Brooklyn than she did afterwards.
And in the later years she made still further
discoveries as to dress that resulted in another revolution,
away from quietness, not toward the gaudy but
toward smartness&mdash;that curious quality which makes a
woman&#8217;s toilet conspicuous without the least suggestion
of the loud.</p>

<p>However, Edna scorned my suggestion that she
make haste slowly. She had long been engaged in a
thorough study of the mode of life in millionairedom.
Newspapers, Sunday supplements, magazines, and society
novels had helped her. She had examined the
exteriors of the famous palaces. She had got into the
drawing-rooms and ballrooms of two or three palaces
by way of high-priced charity tickets. She had in one
instance roamed into sitting rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms
until caught and led back by some vigilant and
unbribable servant. I wonder if she ever recalls that
adventure now! Probably not. I think I have recorded
her ability absolutely to forget whatever it pleases her
not to remember. She had been educating herself, so
when I suggested caution, she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret, Godfrey. I know what I&#8217;m about.
I&#8217;ll get what we&#8217;ve got to have.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll concede that she did&mdash;also, that I thought
it overwhelmingly grand at the time. It was a house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
in a fashionable side street, between Madison avenue
and Fifth&mdash;a magnificent house built for exactly such
a family as mine. That is, it was built entirely for show
and not at all for comfort; it fairly bristled with the
luxuries and &#8220;modern conveniences,&#8221; but most of them
were of the sort that looks comfortable but is not. The
rent was some preposterous sum&mdash;thirty-five or forty
thousand a year. We had room enough for the housing
of nearly a hundred people, counting servants as people,
which I believe is not the custom. It was fitted throughout
in the fashion which those clever leeches who think
out and sell luxuries have in all ages imposed upon the
rich man because it means money in their pockets.
Once in a while you find a rich man who has the courage
to live as he pleases, but most of them live as the
fashion commands. And many of them have no idea
that there is any less comfortless and less foolish way
to live. You imagine, gentle reader, that people with
money live in beauty and comfort. You imagine that
you could do it also if you had but the wealth. Believe
me, you deceive yourself. Beyond question a certain
amount of money is necessary to the getting of attractive
and comfortable surroundings. But there is another,
an equally indispensable and a far rarer factor.
That factor, gentle reader, is intelligence&mdash;knowledge
of the resources of civilization, knowledge of the realities
as to comfort, luxury, and taste.</p>

<p>I am tempted to linger upon the details of the extravagance
of that first big establishment of Edna&#8217;s.
It was so astounding and so ridiculous. I saw that she
had delivered us and our fortune over to hordes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
crafty, thirsty bloodsuckers&mdash;merchants, tradesmen,
servants. But her heart was set upon it, and all other
rich people were living in that same way. &#8220;You want
to do the right thing by Margot, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;By you and Margot,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Go ahead. I
guess I can find the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shan&#8217;t here go into the ways I discovered or invented
for finding that money. They were not too
scrupulous, but neither were they commercially dishonorable.
I must smile there. Being of an inquiring and
jocose mind I have often tried to find an action that,
in the opinion of the most eminent commercial authorities,
was absolutely dishonorable. Never yet have I
found a single action, however wrong and even criminal
in general, that they would not declare in certain circumstances
perfectly honorable. And those &#8220;certain
circumstances&#8221; could always be boiled down to the one
circumstance&mdash;needing the money.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t recall exactly how many servants we had to
wait on us two, but it was about thirty-five. I remember
hearing my wife say one month that our meat bill
alone was about a thousand dollars. For a time I fancied
we were living more grandly than anyone else in
town. But it soon revealed itself to me that, as things
went with &#8220;our class,&#8221; we were leading rather a simple
life. Certainly nothing we did marked us out from the
others in that region. The sum totals suggested that
servants stood at the front windows all day long tossing
money into the street. But nothing of the kind occurred.
You would have said we ate the finest food in wholesale
quantities. Yet never did I get a notably good meal at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
my own house. The coffee was always poor. The fruit
was below the average of sidewalk stands. We often
had cold-storage fowls and fish on the table. We paid
for the best; I&#8217;m sure we paid for it many times over.
We got&mdash;what one always gets when the wife is too
intellectual and too busy to attend to her business. But
I assure you it was grandly served. The linen and the
dishes were royal, the servants were in liveries of impressive
color and form&mdash;though I could have wished
that my wife had been as sensitive to odors as I was,
and had compelled some of those magnificent gentry to
do a little bathing. Throughout the establishment the
same superb scale was maintained. We lived like the
rest of the millionaires, neither better nor worse. We
lived in grandeur and discomfort. But my wife was
ecstatic, and I was therefore content. Yes, we were very
grand. And, as in Brooklyn, the glasses came to the
table with a certain sour odor not alluring as you lifted
them to drink&mdash;the odor that causes an observant man
or woman to say, &#8220;Aha&mdash;dirty rags in this perfect
lady&#8217;s kitchen&mdash;dirty rags and all that goes with them.&#8221;
But only a snarling cynic would complain of these vulgar
trifles. There&#8217;s always at least a fly leg in the
ointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you I knew what I was about?&#8221; said
Edna triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we got what we wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; said I, perhaps somewhat abruptly, for
I was just then wondering how the devil we were going
to keep it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;And if it hadn&#8217;t been for me,&#8221; proceeded she &#8220;we&#8217;d
still be living in <i>Brooklyn</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or in Passaic,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>speak</i> of Passaic,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying
to forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were very happy then,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> was miserable,&#8221; retorted she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could find it in my heart to wish we weren&#8217;t <i>always</i>
attended by servants,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I almost never
see you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a bourgeois you are,&#8221; laughed she. Then&mdash;after
a thorough glance round to make sure housekeeper
or maid or lackey wasn&#8217;t on watch&mdash;she patted
my cheek and kissed me, and added: &#8220;But you do make
me happy. I&#8217;m <i>so</i> proud of you! No matter what I
want I&#8217;m never afraid to buy it, for I know you can
get all the money you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>I winced. Said I: &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;d not be proud
of some of the ways I get the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>She frowned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk business, please,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;You know we never have in all our married life.
You&#8217;ve always respected my position as your wife. All
business is low&mdash;is mere sordidness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all low,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Sometimes I think all
living is low as well. Edna&#8221;&mdash;I put my arm round her&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t
you ever feel that we&#8217;d be <i>really</i> happy, that
we&#8217;d get something genuine out of life&mdash;if you and
Margot and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped my mouth with a kiss. &#8220;You never
will grow up to your station, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said no more. Indeed, it was on hastiest impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that I had said so much, an impulse sprung from a
mood of depression.</p>

<p>The cause of that mood was a nasty reverse in Wall
Street. It had rudely halted me in my triumphant way
toward the security of the man of many millions. It
had set me to wavering uncertainly, with the chances
about even for resuming the march and for tumbling
into the abyss of a discreditable bankruptcy.</p>

<p>There are in New York two well-defined classes of
the rich&mdash;the permanently rich and the precariously
rich. The permanently rich are those who by the vastness
of their wealth or by the strength of their business
and social connections cannot possibly be dislodged
from the plutocracy. The precariously rich are those
who have much money and are making more, but are
not strong enough to survive a series of typhoons,
and are without the support of indissoluble business
and social connections. My friend G&mdash;&mdash;, for example,
head of the famous banking house, associated in
business and by marriage with half the permanent plutocracy,
was practically bankrupt in the late panic.
Had he been a man of ordinary position he would have
gone into bankruptcy, and, I more than suspect, into
jail. But his fellow plutocrats dared not let him drop,
much as they would have liked to see his arrogance
brought low, much as they longed to divide among themselves
his holdings of gilt-edged securities; if he had
gone down it would have made the whole financial world
tremble. He was saved. On the other hand, my friend
J&mdash;&mdash;, richer actually, was ruined, was plucked by his
associates, was finally jailed for doing precisely the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
things every man of finance did over and over again
in that same period of stress&mdash;for, what invariably happens
to moral codes in periods of stress?</p>

<p>I was at that time&mdash;but not now, gentle reader, so
cheer up and read on&mdash;I was at that time in the class
not of the permanently but of the precariously rich.
And through a miscalculation I had laid myself open to
the dangers that lie in wait for the man short of ready
cash. The miscalculation was as to the extravagance
of my wife&#8217;s undertakings. She, against my express request,
had contracted without consulting or telling me
several enormous bills. It is idle to say she ought not
have done this. I knew her well; I should have been on
guard. I had begun my married life wrong, as the
young man very much in love is apt to do; so, to hold
her love and liking, I had to keep on giving her taste
for spending money free rein. If I had not, she would
have thought me small and mean, would have made life
at home exceedingly uncomfortable for me, for I am
not of those men who can take from a woman what
they wish whether she wishes to give or not. So the
whole fault was mine. When the storm broke, in the
light of its first terrific flash that illuminated for me
every part of my affairs, I discovered that I was not
prepared as I had been imagining. The big bills of
my wife were presented, for the merchants knew I was
heavily interested in the stocks that were tobogganing.
Those bills had to be paid, and paid at once, or it
would run like wildfire uptown and down that I was in
difficulties; and when a man is known to be in financial
difficulties, how the birds and beasts of prey from eagles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and lions to buzzards and jackals do come flapping and
loping!</p>

<p>There followed several anxious days and nights. On
one of those nights I rose from beside my wife&mdash;we still
slept together&mdash;and went into the adjoining room. I
turned on an electric light and began for the thousandth
time, I dare say, to look at the critical papers and to
grope for the desperate &#8220;way out.&#8221; I was startled by
my wife&#8217;s voice&mdash;sleepy, peevish:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do turn out that light and come to bed, Godfrey.
You know how it disturbs me for you to get up
in the night. And I&#8217;ve such a hard day before me to-morrow
with the upholsterers and curtain people.&#8221;</p>

<p>I obediently turned off the light. As I was about
to throw myself into bed and draw the covers over me,
a broad beam from the moon flooded the face of a portrait
on the opposite wall&mdash;the face of my daughter
Margot. I sat on the edge of the bed and looked at
that face&mdash;pure, sweet, with the same elevated expression
her mother had in these days of refinement and
climbing. Said I to Edna:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you asleep, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered crossly. &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for you
to quiet down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;let me talk to you a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please!&#8221; she cried, flinging herself to the far
edge of the bed. &#8220;You have no consideration for me&mdash;none
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;m face to face with ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not move or speak, but I could feel her
intense attention.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;If I let matters take their course I can save my
reputation and my official position. But for many
years we&#8217;ll have to live quietly&mdash;about as we did in
Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> do that,&#8221; cried she. &#8220;The fall would kill
me. You know how proud I am.... Just as I had
everything ready for us to get into society! Godfrey,
how could you! And I thought you were clever at
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not see her, nor she me, except in dimmest
outline. I said: &#8220;But we&#8217;d have each other and Margot.
And my salary isn&#8217;t so small, as salaries go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there <i>any</i> way to avoid it?&#8221; She was sitting
up in bed, her nervous fingers upon my arm. &#8220;You
must <i>think</i>, Godfrey. You mustn&#8217;t play Margot and
me this horrible trick. You mustn&#8217;t give up so easily.
You must think&mdash;think&mdash;<i>think</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not slept for three days
and nights. There&#8217;s no way&mdash;no honest way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there <i>is</i> a way!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;But not an honest one.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully. &#8220;And you pretend to love
me! When my life and Margot&#8217;s happiness are at stake
you talk like a Sunday-school boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve been thinking more or
less that way lately for the first time in years. It wasn&#8217;t
long after I started when I cut my business eye teeth.
I found out that as the game lay I&#8217;d not get far if I
stuck to the old maxims of the copy book and the Sunday
school. Except by accident nobody ever got rich
who followed them. To get rich you&#8217;ve got to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
a lot of people work for you and work cheap, and
you&#8217;ve got to sell what they make as dear as you can.
Success in business means taking advantage of the ignorance
or the necessities of your fellow men, or both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste time talking that kind of nonsense,&#8221;
said she impatiently. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean anything to
me&mdash;or to anybody, I guess. The thing for you to do
is to put your mind on the real thing&mdash;how to save your
family and yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;m
talking about saving myself and my family. As I told
you, my troubles&mdash;the first business troubles I&#8217;ve ever
had&mdash;have set me to thinking. I&#8217;ve not been doing
right all these years. It&#8217;s true, everybody does as I&#8217;ve
been doing. It&#8217;s true I&#8217;ve been more generous and
more considerate than most men with opportunities and
the sense to see them. But I&#8217;ve been doing wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused, hoping for some sign of sympathy. None
came. I went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve been wondering these last few days if by
doing it I haven&#8217;t been ruining myself and my family&mdash;not
financially, but in more important ways. Edna,
what&#8217;s the sense in this life we&#8217;re leading? What will
be the end of it all? Is there any decency or happiness
in it? Haven&#8217;t we been going backward instead of
forward?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the time I was talking I could feel she was not
listening. When I finished she said: &#8220;Godfrey, what is
this way you can escape by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can sell out my partners in the deals that have
gone bad.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;re selling <i>you</i> out,&#8221; she instantly
suggested. &#8220;Why, of course they are doing that very
thing!&mdash;while <i>you</i> are driveling about honesty like a
backwoods hypocrite of a church deacon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re not selling me out,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught them at that trick in a former deal and
in the early stages of this one. And I fixed things so
that, while they have to trust me, I don&#8217;t trust them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed mockingly. &#8220;Godfrey, I think your
mind must be going. You talking about sacrificing
your fortune and your wife and your child for men
who&#8217;ve tried to ruin you&mdash;men who are even now thinking
out some scheme for doing it.... Suppose you
saved yourself and let them go&mdash;what then? Wouldn&#8217;t
you be rich? And when you were secure again couldn&#8217;t
you pay them back what they lost if you were still
foolish enough to think it necessary?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not the first time she had astonished me with
the depth of her practical insight&mdash;and her skill at
logic&mdash;when she cared to use her mind. &#8220;I had thought
of saving myself and paying back afterwards,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d save myself. It&#8217;s simply my one
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve got to take that chance,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect you to talk like this,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;The only reason I haven&#8217;t spoken of my troubles before
was that I feared you&#8217;d forbid me to do what I was
being tempted to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that was the truth about my feeling. I had
always heard&mdash;and had firmly believed&mdash;that woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
was somehow the exemplar of ideal morality, that it
was she who kept men from being worse than they were,
that the evil being done by men pursuing success was
done without the knowledge of their pure, idealist wives
and mothers and daughters. I can&#8217;t account for my
stupidity in this respect. Had I not on every side the
spectacle that gave the lie to the shallow pretense of
feminine moral superiority? Was it not the women,
with their insatiable appetite for luxury and splurge;
was it not the women, with their incessant demands for
money and ever more money; was it not the women,
with their profound immorality of any and every class
that earns nothing and simply spends; was it not the
women, the <i>ladies</i>, who were edging on the men to get
money, no matter how? For whom were the grand
houses, the expensive hotels, the exorbitant flimsy clothing,
the costly jewelry, the equipages, the opera boxes,
the senseless, spendthrift squandering upon the degrading
vanities of social position?</p>

<p>I laughed somewhat cynically. &#8220;No wonder you&#8217;ve
always refused to learn anything about business,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;It&#8217;s a habit among big business men to refuse to
know anything as to the details of a large transaction
that can be carried through only by dirty work. If
we don&#8217;t know, we can pretend that the dirty work isn&#8217;t
being done by or for us&mdash;isn&#8217;t being done at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you are getting coarse,&#8221; said my wife. &#8220;Do
you know what I think of you?&#8221; I could not see her
expression, but the voice always betrays if there is insincerity,
because we do not deal enough with the blind
to learn to deceive perfectly with the voice. Her tones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
were absolutely sincere as she answered her own question:
&#8220;I think it is cowardly of you to come to me with
your business troubles. If you were brave you&#8217;d simply
have quietly done whatever was necessary to save your
family. Yes, it is cowardly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it as cowardice,&#8221; said I, admiring
but irritated by this characteristic adroitness. &#8220;In the
stories and the plays that give such thrills, the husband,
in the crisis and tempted to do wrong, appeals to his
wife. And they are brought closer together, and she
helps him to do right, and everything ends happily.&#8221;
Again I laughed good-humoredly. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem
to be turning out that way, does it, dear? My heavenly
picture of you and Margot and me living modestly and
making up in love what we lack in luxury&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t
attract you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said in her patient, superior tone: &#8220;I suppose
you never will understand me or my ideals. What
you&#8217;ve been doing in annoying me with your business,
it&#8217;s as if when I was giving a dinner I assembled my
guests and compelled them to watch all the preparations
for the dinner&mdash;the killing of the lambs and the
fish and the birds, the cleaning, all those ugly and low
things. Bringing business into the home and the social
life, it&#8217;s like bringing the kitchen into the drawing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The obvious answer to this shallow but plausible and
attractive cleverness of hers did not come to me then.
If it had I&#8217;d not have spoken it. For of what use to
argue with the human animal, female or male, about its
dearest selfishnesses and vanities? Of what use to point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
out to human self-complacence, greediness and hypocrisy
that a &#8220;refined&#8221; and &#8220;cultured&#8221; existence of ease
and luxury can be obtained only by the theft and murder
of dishonest business&mdash;that for one man to be vastly
rich thousands of men must somehow be robbed and
oppressed, even though the rich man himself directly
does no robbing and oppressing? If I have sucking
pig for dinner, I kill sucking pig as surely as if my
hand wielded the knife of the butcher. But the human
race finds it convenient and comfortable not to think so.
Therefore, let us not bother our heads about it.</p>

<p>At that period of my career I had not thought things
out so thoroughly as I have since&mdash;in these days when
events have compelled me to open my eyes and to see.
In my hypocrisy, in my eagerness to save myself, I was
not loth to take refuge behind the advice given by my
wife partly in genuine ignorance of business, partly in
pretended ignorance of it.</p>

<p>Said I: &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right. I ought to think
only of my family. Heaven knows, my rascal friends
aren&#8217;t thinking in my interest. If I don&#8217;t do it, no one
will. There&#8217;s no disputing that&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>No reply. She was asleep&mdash;or, rather, was pretending
to be asleep. The matter had been settled, why discuss
it further? Why expose herself longer than unavoidable
to the danger of being unable to be, or to
pretend to be, ignorant of business, of the foundation
upon which her splendid, cultured structure of ambition
proudly reared?</p>

<p>Often in her sleep her hand would seek mine, and
when it was comfortably nestled she would give a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
sigh of content that thrilled me through and through.
Her hand now stole into mine and the sigh of content
came softly from her lips. &#8220;My love,&#8221; I murmured,
kissing her cheek before I lay down. How could I for
a minute have considered any course that would have
made her unhappy, that might have lessened, perhaps
destroyed, her love for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is hardly necessary to say that I threw overboard
my partners and saved myself. Indeed, I emerged from
the crisis&mdash;liberally bespattered with mud, it is true&mdash;but
richer than when I entered it. Since I was doing
the act that was the supreme proof of my possessing the
courage and the skill for leadership in business&mdash;since I
was definitely breaking with the old-fashioned morality&mdash;I
felt it was the part of wisdom to do the thing so
thoroughly, so profitably, that instead of being execrated
I should be admired. There were attacks on me
in the newspapers; there were painful interviews with
my partners&mdash;not so painful to me as they would have
been had I not been able to remind them of their own
unsuccessful treacheries and to enforce the spoken reminder
with the documentary proof. But on the whole
I came off excellently well&mdash;as who does not that &#8220;gets
away with the goods?&#8221;</p>

<p>In these days of increased intelligence and consequent
lessened hypocrisy, the big business man is the object of
only perfunctory hypocrisies from outraged morality.
It has been discovered that the farmer watering his milk
or the grocer using solder-&#8220;mended&#8221; scales is as bad
as the man who &#8220;reorganizes&#8221; a railway or manipulates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
a stock&mdash;is worse actually because the massed mischief
of the million little business rascals is greater than
the sensational misdeeds of the few great rascals. It
has been discovered that human nature is good or bad
only according to the opportunities and necessities, not
according to abstract moral standards. And the cry
is no longer, &#8220;Kill the scoundrel,&#8221; but, &#8220;That fellow
had the sense to outwit us. We must learn from him
how to sharpen our wits so that we won&#8217;t let ourselves
be robbed.&#8221; A healthful sign this, that masses of men
are ceasing from twaddle about vague ideals and are
educating themselves in practical horse sense. It may
be that some day the honest husbandman will learn to
guard his granary not only against the robber with
the sack in the dark of the morn, but also against the
rats and mice who pilfer ten bushels to every one that
is stolen. Of one thing I am certain&mdash;until men learn
to take heed in the small, they will remain easy prey in
the large.</p>

<p>Far from doing me harm, my bold stroke was of
the greatest benefit&mdash;from the standpoint of material
success, and that is the only point of view I am here
considering. It did me as much good with the world as
it has done me with you, gentle reader. For while you
are exclaiming against my wickedness you are in your
secret heart confessing that if I had chosen the ideally
honest course, had retired to obscurity and poverty,
you would have approved&mdash;and would have lost interest
in me. Why, if I had chosen that ideal course, I doubt
not I should have lost my railway position. My directors
would have waxed enthusiastic over my &#8220;old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
honesty,&#8221; and would have looked round for another
and shrewder and stronger man to whom to
intrust the management of their railway&mdash;which would
not pay dividends were it run along the lines of old-fashioned
honesty. The outburst of denunciation soon
spent itself, like a summer storm beating the giant cliffs
of a mountain. Of what use to rage futilely against
my splendid immovable fortune? The attacks, the talk
about my bold stroke, the exaggerations of the size
of the fortune I had made, all served to attract attention
to me, to make me a formidable and an interesting
figure. I leaped from obscurity into fame and
power&mdash;and I had the money to maintain the position
I had won.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Long before, indeed as soon as we moved to Manhattan,
my wife had joined fashionable and exclusive
Holy Cross Church and had plunged straightway into
its charity work. A highly important part of her
Brooklyn education had been got in St. Mary&#8217;s, in
learning how to do charity work and how to make it
count socially. Edna genuinely loved charity work.
She loved to patronize, loved to receive those fawning
blessings and handkissings which city poverty becomes
adept at giving the rich it lives off of. The poor family
understands perfectly that the rich visit and help
not through mere empty sentimental nonsense of
brotherhood, but to have their vanities tickled in exchange
for the graciousness of their condescending
presence and for the money they lay out. As the poor
want the money and have no objection to paying for it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
with that cheap and plentiful commodity, cringing&mdash;scantily
screening mockery and contempt&mdash;rich and
poor meet most comfortably in our cities. Not New
York alone, but any center of population, for human
nature is the same, city and country, San Francisco,
Bangor&mdash;Pekin or Paris, for that matter.</p>

<p>There is a shallow fashion of describing this or that
as peculiarly New York, usually snobbishness or domestic
unhappiness or wealth worship, dishonest business
men or worthless wives. It is time to have done with
such nonsense. New York is in no way peculiar, nor is
any other place, beyond trifling surface differences.
New York is nothing but the epitome of the whole country,
just as Chicago is. If you wish to understand
America, study New York or Chicago, our two universal
cities. There you find in one place and in admirable
perspective a complete museum of specimens of what is
scattered over three and a half million square miles.
For, don&#8217;t forget, New York is not the few blocks of
fashionable district alone. It is four million people of
all conditions, tastes, and activities. And the dominant
force of struggle for money and fashion is no more
dominant in New York than it is in the rest of America.
New York is more truly representative of America than
is Chicago, for in Chicago the Eastern and Southern elements
are lacking and the Western element is strong
out of proportion.</p>

<p>I was telling of my wife&#8217;s blossoming as Lady Bountiful
in search not of a heavenly crown, but of what
human Lady Bountiful always seeks&mdash;social position.
Charity covers a multitude of sins; the greatest of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
is hypocrisy. I have yet to see a charitable man or
woman or child whose chief and only noteworthy object
was not self-glorification. The people who believe in
brotherhood do not go in for charity. They wish to
abolish poverty, whereas charity revels in poverty and
seeks to increase it, to change it from miserable poverty
which might die into comfortable pauperism which can
live on, and fester and breed on, and fawn on and give
vanity ever more and more exquisite titillations. Holy
Cross, my wife&#8217;s new spiritual guide, was past master
of the pauper-making and pauper-utilizing arts. Its
rector and his staff of slimy sycophants had the small
standing army of its worthy poor trained to perfection.
When my wife went down among them, she returned
home with face aglow and eyes heavenly. What a treat
those wretches had given her! And in the first blush of
her enthusiasm she dispensed lavishly, where the older
members of the church exacted the full measure of titillation
for every dollar invested and awarded extra sums
only to some novelty in lickspittling or toadeating.</p>

<p>Were I not sure I should quite wear out the forbearance
of gentle reader, I should linger to describe
this marvelous charity plant for providing idle or social-position-hunting
rich women with spiritual pleasures&mdash; I
had almost said debaucheries, but that would be intruding
my private and perhaps prejudiced opinion.
I have no desire to irritate, much less shake the faith
of, those who believe in Holy Cross and its &#8220;uplift&#8221;
work. And I don&#8217;t suppose Holy Cross does any great
amount of harm. The poor who prostitute themselves
to its purposes are weak things, beyond redemption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
As for the rich who waste time and money there, would
they not simply waste elsewhere were there no Holy
Cross?</p>

<p>My wife was, at that time, a very ignorant woman,
thinly covered with a veneer of what I now know was a
rather low grade of culture. That veneer impressed
me. It had impressed our Brooklyn friends of St.
Mary&#8217;s. But I fancy it must have looked cheap to
expert eyes. Where her surpassing shrewdness showed
itself was in that she herself recognized her own shortcomings.
Rare and precious is the vanity that comforts
and sustains without self-deception. She knew
she wasn&#8217;t the real thing, knew she had not yet got
hold of the real thing. And when she began to move
about, cautiously and quietly, in Holy Cross, she realized
that at last she was in the presence of the real thing.</p>

<p>My big responsibilities, my associations in finance,
had been giving me a superb training in worldly wisdom.
I think I had almost as strong a natural aptitude
for &#8220;catching on&#8221; to the better thing in speech
and manner and in dress as had Edna. It is not self-flattery
for me to say that up to the Holy Cross period
I was further advanced than she. Certainly I ought
to have been, for a man has a much better opportunity
than a woman, and one of the essentials of equipment
for great affairs is ability to observe accurately the little
no less than the large. Looking back, I recall things
which lead me to suspect that Edna saw my superiority
in certain matters most important to her, and was irritated
by it. However that may be, a few months in
Holy Cross and she had grasped the essentials of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
social art as I, or any other masculine man, never could
grasp it. And her veneer of &#8220;middle-class&#8221; culture
disappeared under a thick and enduring coating of the
best New York manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has become of <i>you</i>?&#8221; I said to her. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t seen you in weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said she, ruffling as she always
did when she suspected me of indulging in my
coarse and detestable sense of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t act like yourself at all,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Even when we&#8217;re alone you give the uncomfortable
sense of dressed-up&mdash;not as if <i>you</i> were &#8216;dressed-up,&#8217;
but as if <i>I</i> were. I feel like a plowboy before a
princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was delighted!</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;are now exactly like the rest of
those women in Holy Cross. I suppose it&#8217;s all right to
look and talk and act that way before people. At least,
I&#8217;ve no objection if it pleases you. But for heaven&#8217;s
sake, Edna, don&#8217;t spoil our privacy with it. The queen
doesn&#8217;t wear her coronation robes all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; cried I, laughing. &#8220;What a charming
fraud you are!&#8221; And I seized her in my arms and
kissed her. And she seemed to yield and to return my
caresses. But I was uncomfortable. She would not
drop that new manner. The incident seems trifling
enough; perhaps it was trifling. But it stands out in
my memory. It marks the change in our relationship.
I recall it all distinctly&mdash;how she looked, how young and
charming and cold, what she was wearing, the delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
simple dress that ought to have made her most alluring
to me, yet made me feel as if she were indeed alluring,
but not for <i>me</i>. A subtle difference there, but abysmal;
the difference between the woman who tries to make herself
attractive for the sake of her husband and the woman
who makes toilets in the conscious or half-conscious
longing successfully to prostitute herself to the eyes of
the public. I recall every detail of that incident; yet I
have only the vaguest recollection of our beginning to
occupy separate bedrooms. By that time the feeling of
alienation must have grown so strong that I took the
radical change in our habits as the matter of course.</p>

<p>Many are the women, in all parts of the earth, who
have sought to climb into the world of fashion by the
broad and apparently easy stairway of charity. But
most of them have failed because they were unaware of
the secret of that stairway, an unsuspected secret
which I shall proceed to point out. It seems, as I have
said, a particularly easy stairway&mdash;broad, roomy, with
invalid steps. It is, in fact, a moving stairway so cunningly
contrived that she&mdash;it is usually she&mdash;who ascends
keeps in the same place. She goes up, but at
exactly her ascending rate the stairway goes down. She
sees other women making apparently no more effort
than she ascending rapidly, and presently entering the
earthly heaven at the top. Yet there she stands, marking
time, moving not one inch upward, and there she
will stand until she wearies, relaxes her efforts, and
finds herself rapidly descending. But how do the
women who ascend accomplish it? I do not know. You
must ask them. I only know the cause of the failure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
of the women who do not ascend. If I knew why the
others succeeded I should not tell it. I would not deprive
fashionable women of the joy of occupying a difficult
height from which they can indulge themselves
in the happiness of sneering and spitting down at
their lowlier sisters. And I have no sympathy with
the aspirations or the humiliations of those lowlier
sisters.</p>

<p>My energetic and aspiring wife presently found
herself on this stairway, with no hint as to its secret,
much less as to the way of overcoming its peculiarity.
She toiled daily in Holy Cross. She subscribed to
everything, she helped in everything. She was the
proud recipient of the rector&#8217;s loud praises as his &#8220;most
devoted, least worldly, most spiritual helper.&#8221; But&mdash;not
an invitation of the kind she wanted. Everyone
was &#8220;just lovely&#8221; to her. Whenever any charitable
or spiritual matter was to be discussed, no matter how
grand and exclusive the house in which the discussion
was to be held, there was my wife in a place of honor,
eagerly consulted&mdash;and urged to subscribe. But nothing
unworldly. They understood how spiritual she was,
did those sweet, good people. They knew Saint Edna
wished no social frivolities&mdash;no dinners or theater parties,
no bridge or dancing.</p>

<p>She was a wise lady. She hid her burning impatience.
She smiled and purred when she yearned to
scowl and scratch. She waited, and prayed for some
lucky accident that would swing her across the invisible,
apparently nonexistent but actually impassable dead
line. She had expected snubs and cold shoulders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Never a snub, never a cold shoulder. Always smiles
and gracious handshakings and amiable familiarities,
but those always of the kind that serve to accentuate
caste distinction instead of removing it. For the first
time in her life, I think, she was completely stumped.
She could combat obstacles. She might even have
found a way to fight fog. But how ridiculous to make
struggles and thrust out fists when there is nothing
but empty, sunny air!</p>

<p>She held church lunches and dinners at our house&mdash;of
course, had me on duty at the dinners. All in vain.
The distinction between the spiritual and the temporal
remained in force. The grand people came, acted as if
they were delighted, complimented her on her house,
on her hospitality, went away, to invite her to similar
dreary functions at their houses. And my, how it did
cost her! No wonder Holy Cross made a pet of her
and elected me to the board of vestrymen.</p>

<p>Once in a while she would find something in her net,
so slyly cast, so softly drawn. She would have a wild
spasm of joy; then the something would turn out to
be another climber like herself. Those climbers avoided
each other as devils dodge the font of holy water. The
climber she would have caught would be one who, ignorant
of the intricacies of New York society, was under
the impression that the Mrs. Godfrey Loring so conspicuous
in Holy Cross must be a social personage.
They would examine each other&mdash;at a series of joyous
entertainments each would provide for the other, would
discover their mutual mistake&mdash;and&mdash; You know the
contemptuous toss with which the fisherman rids himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of a bloater; you know the hysterical leap of the
released bloater back into the water.</p>

<p>But how it was funny! My wife did not take me
into her confidence as to her social struggles. She maintained
with me the same sweet, elegant exterior of
spiritual placidity with which she faced the rest of the
world. Nevertheless, in a dim sort of way I had some
notion of what she was about&mdash;though, as I was presently
to discover, I was wholly mistaken in my idea of
her progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened to Mrs. Lestrange?&#8221; I said
to her one evening at dinner. &#8220;Is she ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>She cast a quick, nervous glance in the direction of
the butler. I, looking at him by way of a mirror,
thought I saw upon his aristocratic countenance a faint
trace of that insolent secret glee which fills servants
when their betters are humiliated before them. &#8220;Mrs.
Lestrange?&#8221; she said carelessly. &#8220;Oh, I see her now
and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve been inseparable until lately,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;A quarrel, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said my wife tartly.</p>

<p>And she shifted abruptly to another subject. When
I went to the little study adjoining my sitting room to
smoke she came with me. There she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t mention Mrs. Lestrange before the
servants again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s up?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Did she turn out to
be a crook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, no! How coarse you are, Godfrey.
Simply that I was terribly mistaken in her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;She looked like a confidence woman or a madam,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me she was a howling swell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought she was,&#8221; said my wife, and I knew
something important was coming; only that theory
would account for her admitting she had made a mistake.
&#8220;And in a way she was. But they caught her
several years ago taking money to get some dreadful
low Western people into society. Since then she&#8217;s
asked&mdash;she herself&mdash;because she&#8217;s well connected and
amusing. But she can&#8217;t help anyone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And you don&#8217;t feel strong
enough socially as yet to be able to afford the luxury
of her friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong enough!&#8221; said Edna with intense bitterness.
&#8220;I have no position at all&mdash;none whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was surprised, for until that moment I had been
assuming she was on or near the top of the wave, moving
swiftly toward triumphant success. &#8220;You want too
much,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;ve really got all there is to get.
At that last reception of yours you had all the heavy
swells. My valet told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reception to raise funds for the orphanage,&#8221; said
Edna with a vicious sneer&mdash;the unloveliest expression I
had ever seen on her lovely face&mdash;and I had seen not a
few unlovely expressions there in our many married
years, some of them extremely trying years. &#8220;I tell
you I am nobody socially. They take my money for
their rotten old charities. They use me for their tiresome
church work&mdash;and they do nothing for me&mdash;nothing!
How I <i>hate</i> them!&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat smoking my cigar and watching her face. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
was a wonderfully young face. Not that she was so
old; on the contrary, she was still young in years. I
call her face wonderfully young because it had that look
of inexhaustible, eternal youth which is rare even in
the faces of boys and girls. But that evening I was
not thinking so much of her youth and her beauty as
of a certain expression of hardness, of evil passions
rampant&mdash;envy and hatred and jealousy, savage disappointment
over defeats in sordid battles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edna,&#8221; said I, hesitatingly, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you drop
all that? Can&#8217;t you see there&#8217;s nothing in it? You&#8217;re
tempting the worst things in your nature to grow and
destroy all that&#8217;s good and sweet&mdash;all that makes you&mdash;and
me&mdash;happy. People aren&#8217;t necessary to us. And
if you must have friends, surely <i>all</i> the attractive people
in New York aren&#8217;t in that little fashionable set. Judging
from what I&#8217;ve seen of them, they&#8217;re a lot of bores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They look bored here,&#8221; retorted she. &#8220;And no
wonder! They come as a Christian duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;Now, honestly, are those fashionable
people the best educated, the best in any way&mdash;any real
way? I&#8217;ve talked with the men, and the younger ones&mdash;the
ones that go in for society&mdash;are unspeakable rotters.
I wouldn&#8217;t have them about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna&#8217;s eyes flashed, and her form quivered in a gust
of hysterical fury&mdash;the breaking of long-pent passion,
of anger and despair, taking me as an excuse for vent.
&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s terrible to be married to a man who <i>always</i>
misunderstands!&mdash;one who can&#8217;t sympathize!&#8221; cried
she. It was a remark she often made, but never before
had she put so much energy, so much bitterness into it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;What do I misunderstand?&#8221; I asked, more hurt
than I cared to show. &#8220;Where don&#8217;t I sympathize?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about it!&#8221; exclaimed she. &#8220;If I
weren&#8217;t a remarkable woman I&#8217;d have given up long ago&mdash;I&#8217;d
give up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before you smile at her egotism, gentle reader,
please remember that husband and wife were talking
alone; also that with a few pitiful exceptions all human
beings think surpassingly well of themselves, and do
not hesitate to express that good opinion privately. I
guess there&#8217;s more lying done about lack of egotism and
of vanity generally than about all other matters put
together.</p>

<p>Said I: &#8220;You are indeed a wonder, dear. In this
country one sees many astonishing transformations.
But I doubt if there have been many equal to the transformation
of the girl I married into the girl who&#8217;s sitting
before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what good has it done me?&#8221; demanded she.
&#8220;How I&#8217;ve worked away at myself&mdash;inside and out&mdash;and
all for nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve still got <i>me</i>,&#8221; said I jovially, yet in earnest
too. &#8220;Lots of women lose their husbands. I&#8217;ve never
had a single impulse to wander.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the candor of that intimacy she gave me a most
unflattering look&mdash;a look a woman does well not to cast
at a man unless she is more absolutely sure of him than
anyone can be of anything in this uncertain world. I
laughed as if I thought she meant that look as a jest;
I put the look away in my memory with a mark on it
that meant &#8220;to be taken out and examined at leisure.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
But she was absorbed in her chagrin over her social failure;
she probably hardly realized I was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the next move?&#8221; inquired I presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to help,&#8221; replied she&mdash;and I knew
this was what she had been revolving in her mind all
evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t take me away from business,
or keep me up too late to fit myself for the next day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business&mdash;always business,&#8221; said she, in deepest
disgust. &#8220;Do you <i>never</i> think of anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My business and my family&mdash;that&#8217;s my life,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not your family,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;You care nothing
about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edna,&#8221; I said sharply, &#8220;that is unjust and untrue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you give them money, if that&#8217;s what you
mean,&#8221; said she disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I give them love,&#8221; said I. &#8220;The trouble is I
give so freely that you don&#8217;t value it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are a good husband,&#8221; said she carelessly.
&#8220;But I want you to take an interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your social climbing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How insulting you are!&#8221; she cried, with flashing
eyes. &#8220;I am trying to claim the position we are entitled
to, and you speak of me as if I were one of those
vulgar pushers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said I humbly. &#8220;I was merely
joking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often told you that your idea of humor was
revolting.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>I felt distressed for her in her chagrin and despair.
I was ready to bear almost anything she might see fit
to inflict. &#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Whatever it is, I&#8217;ll do it. Do you need more money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need help&mdash;real help,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money&#8217;s god over the realm of fashion, the same
as it is over that of&mdash;of religion&mdash;of politics&mdash;or anything
you please. And luckily I&#8217;ve got that little god
in my employ, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are so powerful,&#8221; said she, &#8220;put me into
fashionable society&mdash;make these people receive me and
come to my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they do,&#8221; I reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean <i>socially</i>,&#8221; cried she. &#8220;<i>Can&#8217;t</i> I make you
understand? Why are business men so dumb at anything
else? Compel these people to take me as one
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Edna, my dear,&#8221; protested I, &#8220;be reasonable.
How can I do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easily, if you&#8217;ve got real power,&#8221; rejoined she.
&#8220;It&#8217;s been done often, I&#8217;ve found out lately. At least
half the leaders in society got in originally by compelling
it. But you, going round among men intimately&mdash;you
must know it&mdash;must have known all along. If
you&#8217;d been the right sort of man I&#8217;d not have to humiliate
myself by asking you&mdash;by saying these dreadful
things.&#8221; Her eyes were flashing and her bosom was
heaving. &#8220;Women have hated men for less. But I
must bear my cross. You insist on degrading me. Very
well. I&#8217;ll let myself be degraded. I&#8217;ll say the things a
decent man would not ask a woman to say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;Edna, darling,&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t
understand. You&#8217;ll have to tell me. And it&#8217;s not degrading.
We have no secrets from each other. We
who love each other can say anything to each other&mdash;anything.
What do you wish me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use your power over the men. Frighten them
into ordering their wives to invite us and to accept
our invitations. You do business with a lot of the men,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can benefit or injure them, as you please,
can&#8217;t you?&mdash;can take money away from them&mdash;can put
them in the way of making it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I; &#8220;to a certain extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you use this power?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In building up great enterprises. I am founding
a city just now, for instance, where there was nothing
but a swamp beside a lake, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In making more and more money for yourself,&#8221;
she cut in, &#8220;you think only of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;what do <i>you</i> think of?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of myself,&#8221; cried she indignantly. &#8220;Never of
myself. Of Margot. Of you. Of the family. I am
working to build <i>us</i> up&mdash;to make <i>us</i> somebody and not
mere low money grubbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not see it from her point of view. But I was
not inclined to aggravate her excitement and anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t you use your powers for some unselfish
purpose?&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Why not try to have
higher ambition?&#8221;</p>

<p>I observed her narrowly. She was sincere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;I want you to help me&mdash;for Margot&#8217;s sake, for
your own sake,&#8221; she went on in a kind of exaltation.
&#8220;Margot is coming on. She&#8217;ll be out in less than three
years. We&#8217;ve got to make a position for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought, up there at Miss Ryper&#8217;s she was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows how little interest you take!&#8221; cried
Edna. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what is happening? Why,
already the fashionable girls at her school are beginning
to shy off from her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd!&#8221; laughed I. &#8220;That simply
could not be. She&#8217;s lovely, sweet, attractive in every
way. Any girls anywhere would be proud to have her
as a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>can</i> you be so ignorant of the world!&#8221; cried
Edna in a frenzy of exasperation. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll drive me
mad with your stupidity! Can&#8217;t you realize how <i>low</i>
fashionable people are. The girls who were her friends
so long as they were all mere children are now taking a
positive delight in snubbing her, because she&#8217;s so pretty
and will be an heiress. It gives them a sense of power
to treat her as an inferior, to make her suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I flung away the cigar and sat up in the chair.
&#8220;How long has this been going on?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly a year,&#8221; replied my wife. &#8220;It began as
soon as she lost her childishness and developed toward
a woman. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve roused you at last. So long
as she was a mere baby they liked her&mdash;invited her to
their children&#8217;s parties&mdash;came to hers. But now they&#8217;re
dropping her. Oh, it&#8217;s maddening! They are so sweet
and smooth, the vile little daughters of vile mothers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible!&#8221; said I. &#8220;Surely not those sweet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
well-mannered girls I&#8217;ve seen here at her parties? <i>They</i>
couldn&#8217;t do that sort of thing. Why, what do those
babies know about social position and such nonsense?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they know? What <i>don&#8217;t</i> they know?&#8221;
cried Edna, trembling with rage at her humiliation and
at my incredulity. &#8220;You <i>are</i> an innocent! There
ought to be a new proverb&mdash;innocent as a married man.
Why, nowadays the children begin their social training
in the cradle. They soon learn to know a nurse or a
butler from a lady or a gentleman before they learn
to walk. They hear the servants talk. They hear their
parents talk. Except innocent you everyone nowadays
thinks and talks about these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Margot&mdash;our Margot&mdash;she doesn&#8217;t know!&#8221;
I said with conviction.</p>

<p>Edna laughed harshly. &#8220;Know? What kind of
mother do you think I am? Of course she knows.
Haven&#8217;t I been teaching her ever since she began to
talk? Why do you suppose I&#8217;ve always called her the
little duchess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She suggests a superior little person,&#8221; said I,
groping vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;She suggests a superior person because I gave
her that name and brought her up to look and act and
feel the part. She expects to be a real duchess some
day&mdash;&#8221; Edna reared proudly, and her voice rang out
confidently as she added&mdash;&#8220;and she shall be!&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared at her. It seemed to me she must be out
of her mind. Oh, I was indeed innocent, gentle reader.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always treated her as a duchess, and have
made the servants do it, and have trained her to treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
them as if she were a duchess.&#8221; A proud smile came
into her face, transforming it suddenly back to its loveliness.
&#8220;The first time I ever read about a duchess&mdash;read,
knowing what I was reading about&mdash;I decided
that I would have a daughter and that she should be a
duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any previous time such a sally would have made
me laugh. But not then, for I saw that she meant it
profoundly, and for the first time I was realizing what
had been going on in my family, all unsuspected by me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But first,&#8221; proceeded Edna, &#8220;she shall have the
highest social position in New York. And you must
help if I am to succeed.&#8221; The fury burst into her face
again. &#8220;Those little wretches, snubbing her!&mdash;dropping
her! I&#8217;ll make them pay for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that Margot realizes all
this?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child, she&#8217;s wretched about it. Only yesterday
she said to me: &#8216;Mamma, is it true that you and
papa are very common, and that we haven&#8217;t anything
but a lot of stolen money? One of the girls got mad
at me because I was so good-looking and so proud, and
taunted me with it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible!&#8221; said I, dazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s horribly unhappy,&#8221; Edna went on. &#8220;And it
cuts her to the heart to be losing all her dearest friends.
I did my duty and taught her which girls to cultivate,
and she was intimate only with the right sort of New
York girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect she has been indiscreet,&#8221; said I. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
found out why she made friends with them and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;You will drive me crazy!&#8221; cried Edna. &#8220;<i>Can&#8217;t</i>
you understand? All the mothers and the governesses&mdash;all
the grown people in respectable families teach the
children. Those mothers who don&#8217;t teach it directly see
that it&#8217;s taught by the governesses, or else select the
proper friends for their little girls and see that they
drop any who aren&#8217;t proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dropped back in my chair. I was stunned. It
seemed to me I had never heard anything quite so infamous
in my life. And as I reflected on what she had
said I wondered that I had not realized it before. I
recalled a hundred significant facts that had come out
in talks I had had with men, women, and children in
this fashionable world from which we were excluded,
yet with which we were in constant and close communication.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is, what are <i>you</i> going to do,&#8221; proceeded
Edna.</p>

<p>I shook my head, probably looking as dazed as I
felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that headshake mean?&#8221; demanded she.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i>&mdash;taught <i>Margot</i> to be a&mdash;a&mdash;like those
other girls?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you fool!&#8221; cried Edna. And in excuse for
her, please remember I had ever been a dotingly bored
slave of hers&mdash;as uxorious a husband as you ever saw&mdash;and
therefore inevitably despised, for women have so
little intelligence that they despise a man who loves
them and lets them rule. &#8220;You fool!&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;Yes, I brought her up like a lady&mdash;taught her to
cultivate nice things and nice people. What should I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
teach her? To associate with common people? To drop
back toward where we came from&mdash;where <i>you</i> belong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess I do,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Up to that time I had interested myself in only one
aspect of human nature&mdash;the aspect that concerned me
as a business man. But from that time I began to study
the human animal in all his&mdash;and her&mdash;aspects. And it
was not long before I learned what that animal is forced
to become when exposed to the powerful thrusts and
temptings of wealth and social position. In our alternations
of pride and humility we habitually take undue
credit or give undue blame to ourselves for what is
wholly the result of circumstance. The truth is, we are
like flocks of birds in a high wind. Some of us fly more
steadily than others, some are quite beaten down, others
seem almost self-directing; but all, great and small,
weak and strong, are controlled by the wind, and those
who make the best showing are those who adapt themselves
most skillfully to the will of the wind.</p>

<p>At the time when Edna and I were talking I had
not become a philosopher. I was in the primitive stages
of development in which most men and nearly all women
remain their whole lives through&mdash;the stage in which
you live, gentle reader, with your shallow mistaken notions
of what is and your shallower mistaken notions
of what ought to be. So, as Edna uncovered herself
to me, I shrank in horror. It was fortunate&mdash;for her,
at least&mdash;that I had always trained myself never to
make hasty speeches. My expertness in that habit has
probably been the principal cause of my business success,
of my ability to outwit even abler men than myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
I did not yield to the impulse to burst out against her.
I compressed my lips and silently watched as she lifted
the veil over our family life and revealed to me the
truth about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; she asked impatiently,
yet with a certain uneasiness born no doubt of
a something in my manner that made her vaguely afraid,
for while she knew I was her slave and despised me, as
I was to learn, for being so weak before a mere woman,
she also knew that, outside of her domain, I was not her
slave nor anybody&#8217;s, but planned and executed at the
pleasure of my own will.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do,&#8221; said I slowly.
&#8220;I must think. All this is new to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you haven&#8217;t any pride in yourself, or in me,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;still you surely must have pride for Margot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could know how they have made the poor
child suffer!&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no reply, nor did I encourage her to talk
further. In fact, when she began again I stopped her
with: &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard enough, my dear. And I&#8217;ve some
important business to attend to.&#8221;</p>

<p>She, preparing to leave me alone with my papers,
came and put her arms round my neck and pressed her
cheek against mine. I think she was uneasy about the
posture of the affair in my mind&mdash;feared stupid commercial
I could not appreciate these vital things of life.
I suspect my tranquil reception of her caresses did not
tend to allay her uneasiness. Never before had she
failed to interest me in her physical self; and the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
reason she then failed was that in the general upsetting
of all my ideas of what my family life was there had
been tossed up to the surface an undefined suspicion of
her sincerity as a wife. I was not altogether blind as
to the relations of men and women, as to the fact that
women often coolly played upon the passions of men
for their own purposes of money getting in its various
forms. My wife was right in her sneer at the innocence
of married men. But there are exceptions, and a woman
with a husband intelligent in every way except in seeing
through women would do well to take care how she
tempts his intelligence to shake off its indifference in
that respect.</p>

<p>The next morning I was breakfasting alone as usual.
No, gentle reader, I am not girding at my poor wife
as you hastily accuse. I am sure I do not deceive myself
when I say I never was of those men who fuss about
trifles. Thank heaven, as soon as we had a servant my
wife kept away from breakfast. It was one of the things
I loved her for. If I had been married to a woman who
appeared at breakfast looking lovely and smiling sweetly,
I should have become a bad-tempered tyrant. I
want no sentimentalities in the early-morning hours. I
wake up uncomfortable and sour, and I quarrel with
myself and look about for trouble until I have had
something to eat and coffee. Further in the same direction,
I took particular pleasure in my wife&#8217;s small personal
slovenlinesses, in her curl papers, in her occasional
overlaying of her face with cold cream and the like, in
her careless negligee worn in her own rooms. There is, I
guess, no nature so prodigal that it has not some small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
economies. Edna had, probably still has, a fondness
for wearing out thoroughly, in secluded privacy, house
dresses, underclothes, and night gowns.</p>

<p>It took nothing from my delight in her beauty that
she was not invariably beautiful. I&#8217;ve rarely seen her
lovely early in the morning. Who is? I should have
taken habitual early-morning loveliness as a personal
insult. I&#8217;ve seen her homely all day long, and for several
days at a time. She was as attractive to me than
as at her most beautiful. I detest monotony. Thank
heaven, she was never monotonous to look at; one rather
expects <i>mental</i> monotony in women unless one is a fool.
I didn&#8217;t mind her times of homeliness, because she could
be so far, far the opposite of homely. I did not mind her
way of getting herself up in odds and ends, mussily,
but, mind you, never after the Passaic days unclean&mdash;never!
I did not mind her dishevelments because, when
she set out to dress, she did it so bang up well. She
was born with a talent for dress; she rapidly developed
it into an art. You know what I mean. You&#8217;ve seen
the girl with hardly five dollars&#8217; worth of clothing on
her, including the hat, yet making the woman from the
best dressmaker in Paris look a frump.</p>

<p>I never had to join the innumerable and pitiful army
of men who give the woman their money to squander
upon bad fits and bad taste, and are bowed down with
shame when they have to issue forth with her. I can
honestly say, and Edna will bear me out, that I gave
her money freely. No doubt the reason in part was I
found it so easy to make money that I was indifferent
to extravagance. But the chief reason, I believe, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Edna&#8217;s skill at dress. The woman who is physically
alluring to her husband, and who knows how to dress,
rarely has difficulty in getting money from him, though
he be a miser. But, gentle lady reader, can you in your
heart blame a man for grudging his earnings to a
woman who isn&#8217;t fit to dress and who doesn&#8217;t know how,
either?</p>

<p>As I had begun to tell when I interrupted myself, I
was breakfasting alone the morning after that memorable
talk with Edna, and Margot came down to
glance in for a smile at me on her way to school.</p>

<p>In theory Margot was still classed as a child, and
would be so classed for two years longer. In fact she
was, and had been for two years and more, a full-fledged
young lady. That is the way American children of the
rank for which my wife was training Margot are being
brought up nowadays. She had her own apartment,
dressing room and bath, sitting room, reception room&mdash;as
many rooms as my wife and I had altogether when
we began married life, and about four times the room.
As for luxury, a comparison would be ridiculous. Also
Margot had her own staff of servants&mdash;companion,
maid, maid&#8217;s assistant&mdash;and her own automobile with
chauffeur, used by no one else. It would be hard to find
more helpless creatures than these young aspirants to
aristocracy. And they prided themselves upon their ignorance
of the realities, and their mothers, often with hypocritical
pretense of distress, boasted it. At that time
I thought it amusing. The serious side of it was entirely
out of my range. We American men of the comfortable
and luxurious classes are addicted to the habit of regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
our wives and children as toys, as mere sources
of amusement not to be taken seriously. It isn&#8217;t strange
that the children should not mind this, but what a commentary
upon the real mentality of the women that they
tolerate and encourage it! Our women are always,
with a fine show of earnestness, demanding that they be
taken seriously. But woe unto the man who believes
them in earnest and tries to treat them as his equals
instead of as dainty toys, odalisques. How he will be
denounced, hated, and, if proper alimony can be got,
divorced!</p>

<p>Margot&#8217;s parties differed in no respect from grown-up
parties, except that there were restrictions in the
matter of hours and also as to the serving of drinks.
For, I believe my wife did not follow the extreme of
fashionable custom, but forbade wines and punch at
these parties. In this matter, as in the matter of using
slang and in many others, she held that only people of
long-established social position, people with what is
called tradition, could safely make excursions beyond
the bounds of conventionality; that it was safest, wisest
for people like herself to stay well within the bounds, to
be prim even, and so to avoid any possible criticism as
vulgar. A very shrewd woman was Edna. If her intelligence
had been equal to her shrewdness and energy,
and if she had possessed a gleam of the sense of humor!
However&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In no essential respect did Margot&#8217;s routine of life
differ from that of her mother&mdash;and her mother&#8217;s routine
of inane and worthless time-killing was modeled
exactly upon that of all the fashionable women and apers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
of fashionable women. Edna did a vast amount of
studying, with and without teachers. It was all shallow
and showy. Margot&#8217;s studies were also beneath contempt.
I amused myself from time to time by inquiring&mdash;with
pretense of gravity&mdash;into what they were
teaching her at the Ryper school for the turning out of
fashionable womanhood. Such a mess of trash! She
was learning much about social usages, from how to sit
in a carriage&mdash;a rare art that, I assure you, gentle
reader&mdash;to how to receive guests at a large dinner.
She was studying some of the vulgarities&mdash;science, history,
literature, and the like&mdash;but in no vulgar way.
She would get only the thinnest smatter of talkable stuff
about them&mdash;nothing &#8220;unsettling,&#8221; nothing that might
possibly rouse the mind to think or distract the attention
from the &#8220;high&#8221; things of life. She was dabbling
in music, in drawing, in several similar costly fripperies.
And the sum total of expense!&mdash;well, no wonder Miss
Ryper was fast becoming as rich as some of the asteroids
in the plutocracy she adored.</p>

<p>I regarded Margot&#8217;s education as a species of
joke. It never occurred to me that our pretty baby
had the right to be educated to become a wife and a
mother. And why should it have occurred to me?
Where is that being done? Who is thinking of it? In
all the oceans of twaddle about the elevation of woman
where is there a drop of good sense about <i>real</i> education?
You say I was criminally negligent as to my
daughter&#8217;s education. But how about your own? The
truth is, we all still look upon education as a frill, an
ornament. We never think of it, whether for our sons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
or for our daughters, as nothing more or less than
teaching a human being how to live. It is high time to
end this idiotic ignorant exaltation of tomfoolery into
culture!</p>

<p>Poor Margot! How the little girls in plain clothes&mdash;and
machine-made underwear&mdash;must have envied her
as she swept along in her limousine, dressed with that
enormously costly simplicity which only the rich can afford.
No wonder many of the other girls at the Ryper
school hated her. For, her mother was in one respect
unlike most of the fashionable mothers who are too busy
doing things not worth doing to attend to their children.
Her mother gave her loving care, spent many hours&mdash;of
anxious thought, no doubt&mdash;in planning to make her the
most luxurious, the most helpless, the most envied girl
in the school. We hear unendingly about the good that
love does in the world. Not too much&mdash;no, indeed!
But at the same time might it not be well if we also
heard about the harm love can do&mdash;and does? How
many sons and daughters have been ruined by loving
parents! How many husbands have been wrecked by
the flatteries and the assiduities of loving wives! How
many wives have been lured to decay and destruction
by the over-indulgent love of their husbands! What we
need in this world is not more sentiment, but more intelligence.
Sentiment is a force that rushes far and
crazily in <i>both</i> directions, gentle reader, unless it has
well-balanced intelligence to guide it.</p>

<p>Margot, smiling in the doorway of the breakfast
room, put me at once into a less somber humor. She
was tall and slim&mdash;an inch taller than her mother and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
with the same supple, well-proportioned figure. She had
her mother&#8217;s small, tip-tilted face and luminous eyes,
but they were of an intense dark gray that gave her
an expression of poetic thoughtfulness and mystery.
Whiter or more perfectly formed teeth I have never
seen. In former days children&#8217;s teeth were neglected.
But my wife, with her peculiar reach for all matters
having to do with appearances, had learned the modern
methods of caring for the body when Margot was still
in the period when the body is almost as formable as
sculptor&#8217;s clay. Thus Margot&#8217;s teeth had been looked
after and made perfect and kept so. Her hair hung
loose upon her shoulders like a wonderful changeable
veil of golden brown. Often at first glance you are
dazzled by these carefully fed and carefully groomed
children of the rich, only to note at the second glance
that the best showing has been made of precious little
in the way of natural charm. But this was not true of
Margot. The longer you looked, and the more attentively,
the finer she seemed to be&mdash;like a rare perfect
specimen from a connoisseur&#8217;s greenhouses. There&#8217;s no
doubt about it, Edna did know the physical side of life.
She would have got notable results even had we been
poor. As it was, with all the money she cared to spend,
she performed what looked like miracles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and kiss me, Margot,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She obeyed, with a charming air of restrained eagerness
that is regarded as ladylike. &#8220;My car is waiting,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Therese&#8221;&mdash;her maid&mdash;&#8220;out in the hall
waiting to go with you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;Yes. Miss Parnell&#8221;&mdash;her companion&mdash;&#8220;has a
headache, poor creature!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot had caught to perfection the refined, elegant,
fashionable tone of speaking of the servile classes.
Though I was in a critical mood that morning, I was
not critical of my beloved little Margot, and her airs
entertained me as much as ever. Said I:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, little duchess&#8221;&mdash;the familiar name
slipped out unconsciously&mdash;&#8220;and talk to me a few
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m shockingly late, papa,&#8221; pleaded she.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. I&#8217;ll telephone Miss Ryper, if you
wish.&#8221; To the butler, who was serving me: &#8220;Sackville,
go tell Therese that I&#8217;m detaining Miss Margot. And
close the door behind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sackville retired. Margot seated herself with alacrity.
She did not like her useless school any better than
other children like more or less useful schools. &#8220;Are
you taking me to the theater Saturday afternoon, as
you promised?&#8221; said she. &#8220;And do get a box and let
me ask two of the girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said I. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t go, Miss Parnell
will chaperon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I want you, papa. It&#8217;s so nice to have a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you getting on at school? Not with the
studies&#8221;&mdash;I laughed at the absurdity of calling her
fiddle-faddle studies&mdash;&#8220;but with the girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face clouded. &#8220;Has mamma told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Told me what?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, dear,&#8221; said I. &#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s always the same thing,&#8221; she sighed, with
a grown-up air that was both humorous and pathetic.
&#8220;Some of the girls are down on me&mdash;about&mdash;about
social position. You see, we don&#8217;t go <i>socially</i> with their
families.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we?&#8221; said I. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know them
nor they us. Naturally, they don&#8217;t care anything about
us, nor we about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung her head. &#8220;But I want to go with them,&#8221;
said she doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because&mdash;it&#8217;s the proper thing to do. If
you don&#8217;t go with them everybody looks down on you.&#8221;
She lifted her head, and her flashing eyes reminded me
of her mother. &#8220;It makes me just <i>wild</i> to be looked
down on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Those little girls at
Miss Ryper&#8217;s must be an ill-bred lot. We must take
you away from there and put you in a school with nice
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, father!&#8221; she cried in a panic. &#8220;Those
girls are the <i>nicest</i>&mdash;the only nice girls in any school
in New York. All the other schools look up to ours.
I&#8217;d cry my eyes out in any other school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d feel&mdash;<i>low</i>.&#8221; Her eyes had filled and her cheeks
were flushed. &#8220;I&#8217;d be out of place except among the
richest and most aristocratic girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t like them,&#8221; said I gently. I began
to feel a sensation of sickness at the heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>hate</i> them!&#8221; cried she with passionate energy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
&#8220;But I want to stay on there and <i>make</i> them be friendly
with me. I&#8217;ve got too much pride, papa, to run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pride,&#8221; said I, and my tone must have been sad.
&#8220;That isn&#8217;t pride, dear. You ought to choose your
friends by liking. You ought to feel above girls with
such cheap ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not above them,&#8221; protested she. &#8220;And
I couldn&#8217;t like any girl I&#8217;d be ashamed to be seen with,
unless she were a sort of servant. Oh, papa, you don&#8217;t
appreciate how proud I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proud of what, dear? Of your parents? Of yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what, dear?&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;It hurts me not to be treated as&mdash;as the inside
clique of girls in our secret society treat each other.&#8221;
She was almost crying. &#8220;They don&#8217;t even call me by
my first name any more. They speak to me as Miss
Loring&mdash;and <i>so</i> politely&mdash;exactly as I speak to Miss
Parnell or one of the teachers or a servant. Oh, I&#8217;m
so proud! I&#8217;d love to be like Gracie Fortescue. She
speaks even to Miss Ryper as I would to Miss Parnell.&#8221;</p>

<p>My digestion wasn&#8217;t any too good, even in those
days. My whole breakfast suddenly went wrong&mdash;turned
to poison inside me, I suppose. A hot wave of
rage against I knew not whom or what rolled up into
my brain. I pushed away my plate abruptly. &#8220;Run
along, child,&#8221; I said in a hoarse voice I did not recognize
as my own.</p>

<p>She threw her arms round my neck with a gesture
and an expression that made me realize how close a copy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
of her mother she was. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t take me away
from my school, would you, papa dear?&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I want is to make you happy,&#8221; said I, patting
and stroking that thick and lovely veil of flowing hair.</p>

<p>She assumed that I meant she was to stay on with
the viperous Ryper brood, and went away almost happy.
She had awakened to the fact that there were fates
even worse than being snubbed and addressed like a
teacher or a companion or a servant or some other lower
animal&mdash;yes, far worse fates. For instance, not being
able to feel that she was, on whatever degrading terms,
at least associated with the adored fashionables.</p>

<p>That evening when my wife again accompanied me
to my study, after dinner, I said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been turning over our talk last night. I
haven&#8217;t been able to reach a conclusion as yet, except
on one point. I can&#8217;t help you socially in the way you
suggested.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at her as I said this. She was looking at
me. Her pale, intense expression fascinated me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have thought about it fully,&#8221;
said she slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I, with my utmost deliberateness; &#8220;and
my decision is final.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, stood beside her chair, rubbing her hand
softly along the top of the back. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said
she quietly. And she left me alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> refusing Edna her heart&#8217;s desire thus promptly
and tersely I had an object. I assumed she would protest
and argue; in the discussion that would follow some
light might come to me, utterly befogged as to what
course to take about my family affairs. I knew something
should be done&mdash;something quick and drastic.
But what? It was no new experience to me to be faced
with complex and well-nigh impossible situations. My
business life had been a succession of such experiences.
And while I had learned much as to handling them, I
had also learned how dangerous it is to rush in recklessly
and to begin action before one has discovered what to
do&mdash;and what <i>not</i> to do. The world is full of Hasty
Hals and Hatties who pride themselves on their emergency
minds, on knowing just what to do in any situation
the instant it arises; and fine spectacles they are,
lying buried and broken amid the ruins they have aggravated
if not created.</p>

<p>How recover my wife? How rescue my daughter?
I could think of no plan&mdash;of no beginning toward a
plan. And when Edna, by receiving my refusal in cold
silence, defeated my hope of a possibly illuminating discussion,
I did not know which way to turn.</p>

<p>Why had I refused to help her in the way she suggested?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Not on moral grounds, gentle reader. There
I should have been as free from scruple as you yourself
would have been, as you perhaps have been in your social
climbing or maneuvering in your native town, wherever
it is. Nor yet through fear of failure. I did not
know the social game, but I did know something of
human nature. And I had found out that the triumphant
class, far from being the gentlest and most civilized,
as its dominant position in civilization would indicate,
was in fact the most barbarous, was saturated
with the raw savage spirit of the right of might. I
am speaking of actualities, not of pretenses&mdash;of deeds,
not of words. To find a class approaching it in frank
savagery of will and action you would have to descend
through the social strata until you came to the class
that wields the blackjack and picks pockets and dynamites
safes. The triumphant class became triumphant
not by refinement and courtesy and consideration, but
by defiance of those fundamentals of civilization&mdash;by
successful defiance of them. It remained the triumphant
class by keeping that primal savagery of nature. As
soon as any member of it began to grow tame&mdash;gentle,
considerate, except where consideration for others would
increase his own wealth and power, became really a disciple
of the sweet gospel he professed and urged upon
others&mdash;just so soon did he begin to lose his wealth into
the strong unscrupulous hands ever reaching for it&mdash;and
with waning wealth naturally power and prestige
waned.</p>

<p>No, I did not refuse because I thought the triumphant
class would contemptuously repel any attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
carry its social doors by assault. I saw plainly enough
that I could compel enough of these society leaders to
receive my wife and daughters to insure their position.
You have seen swine gathered about a trough, comfortably
swilling; you have seen a huge porker come running
with angry squeal to join the banquet. You have
observed how rudely, how fiercely he is resented and
fought off by the others. This, until he by biting and
thrusting has made a place for himself; then the fact
that he is an intruder and the method of his getting a
place are forgotten, and the swilling goes peacefully
forward. So it is, gentle reader, though it horrifies your
hypocrisy to be told it, so do human beings conduct
themselves round a financial or political or social swill
trough. I should have had small difficulty in biting and
kicking a satisfactory place for Edna and Margot at
the social swill trough; I should have had no difficulty
at all in keeping it for them. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>You will be incredulous, gentle reader, devoured of
snobbishness and dazzled by what you have heard and
read of the glories of fashionable society in the metropolis.
You will be incredulous, because you, too,
like the overwhelming majority of the comfortable
classes in this great democracy&mdash;and many of the not
so comfortable classes as well&mdash;because you, too, are
infected of the mania for looking about for some one
who refuses to associate with you on the ground that
you are &#8220;common,&#8221; and for straightway making it
your heart&#8217;s dearest desire to compel that person to
associate with you. You will be incredulous when I
tell you my sole reason was my hatred and horror of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
what seemed to me the degrading, vulgar, and rotten
longings that filled my wife and that had infected my
daughter. That hatred and horror had thrown me
into a state of mind I did not dare confess to myself.
You are incredulous; but perhaps you will admit I may
be truthful when I explain that the reason for my moral
and sentimental revolt was perhaps in large part my
dense ignorance of the whole society side of life.</p>

<p>No doubt in the Passaic public school of my boyhood
there had been as much snobbishness as there is
in Fifth Avenue. But I had somehow never happened
to notice it. It must have been there; it must be elemental
in human nature; how else account for my wife?
We hear more about the snobbishness of Fifth Avenue
than we do about the snobbishness of the tenements.
But that is solely because Fifth Avenue is more conspicuous.
Also, Fifth Avenue, supposedly educated,
supposedly broadened by knowledge and taste, has no
excuse for petty vanities that belong only to the ignorant.
And if Fifth Avenue were really educated, really
had knowledge and taste, it could not be snobbish.
However, my busy life had never been touched by social
snobbishness. I preferred to know and to associate
with men better educated and richer than I, but for
excellent practical reasons&mdash;because from such men I
could get the knowledge and the wealth I needed. But
I would not have wasted a moment of my precious time
upon the men most exalted in fashionable life&mdash;the ignorant
incompetents who had inherited their wealth.
They seemed ridiculous and worthless to me, a man of
thought and action.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>So, the sudden exposure of my wife&#8217;s and my little
girl&#8217;s disease gave me a shock hardly to be measured
by the man or woman used all his life to the social
craze. It was much as if I had suddenly seen upon
their bared bosoms the disgusting ravages of cancer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I could not devise any line of action that, however
faintly, promised results, I kept away from home.
I absorbed myself in some new enterprises that filled
my evenings, which I spent at my club with the men
I drew into them. At the mention of club, gentle
reader, I see your ears pricking. You are wondering
what sort of club <i>I</i> belonged to. I shall explain.</p>

<p>It was the Amsterdam Club. You may have seen
and gawked at its vast and imposing red sandstone
front in middle Fifth Avenue. As you drove by in the
&#8220;rubber-neck&#8221; wagon, the man with the megaphone
may have shouted: &#8220;The Amsterdam Club, otherwise
known as the Palace of Plutocracy. The total wealth
of its members is one tenth of the total wealth of the
United States. Every great millionaire in New York
City belongs to it. The reason you see no one in the
magnificent windows is because the plutocrats are afraid
of cranks with pistol or bomb.&#8221; And you stared and
envied and craned your neck backward as the sight-seeing
car rolled on. A fairly accurate description
of my club. But you will calm as I go on to tell
you the inside truth about it. It was built to provide
a club for those rich men of New York who had no
social position, and so could not be admitted to the
fashionable clubs. It was not built by those outcasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
for whom it was intended, but by the rich men of the
fashionable world. They did not build it out of pity
nor yet out of generosity, but for freedom and convenience.</p>

<p>You must know that the rich, both the fashionables
and the excludeds, are intimately associated in business.
Now, in the days before the Amsterdam Club, if a rich
fashionable wished to talk business out of office hours
with a rich unfashionable, he had to take him to his
home or to his club, one or the other. You will readily
appreciate that either course involved disagreeable complications.
The rich unfashionable would say: &#8220;Why
am I not invited to this snob&#8217;s house <i>socially</i>? Why
does not this hound see that I am elected to his elegant
club? I&#8217;ll teach this wrinkle-snout how to spit at me.
I&#8217;ll slip a stiletto into his back, damn him.&#8221; As the
number of rich unfashionables increased, as the number
of stealthy financial stilettoings for social insult grew
and swelled, the demand for a &#8220;way out&#8221; became more
clamorous and panicky. The final result was the Amsterdam
Club&mdash;perhaps by inspiration, perhaps by accident.
And so it has come to pass that now, when a
rich fashionable wishes to talk finance with a rich pariah,
he does not have to run the risk of defiling his home or
his exclusive club. With the gracious cordiality wherefor
aristocracy is famed in song and story, he says:
&#8220;Let us go to <i>our</i> club&#8221;&mdash;for, the rich fashionables see
to it that every rich pariah is elected to the Amsterdam
immediately he becomes a person of financial consequence.
And I fancy that not one in ten of the rich
pariah members dreams how he is being insulted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
tricked. All, or nearly all, imagine they are elected by
favor of the great fashionable plutocrats to about the
most exclusive club in New York. Also, not one in a
dozen of the fashionable members appreciates how he is
degrading himself&mdash;for, to my quaint mind, the snob
degrades only himself.</p>

<p>Well! Not many months after we moved from
Brooklyn to Manhattan I was elected to the Amsterdam&mdash;I,
in serene ignorance of the trick that was being
played upon me by my sponsors, associates in large
financial deals and members of several exclusive really
fashionable clubs. They pulled regretful faces as they
talked of the &#8220;long waiting lists at most of the clubs.&#8221;
They brightened as they spoke of the Amsterdam&mdash;&#8220;the
finest and, take it all round, the most satisfactory
of the whole bunch, old man. And we believe we&#8217;ve got
pull enough to put you in there pretty soon. We&#8217;ll
work it, somehow.&#8221; If I had known the shrivel-hearted
trick behind their genial friendliness, I should not have
minded, should probably have laughed. For, human littlenesses
do not irritate me; and I have a vanity&mdash;I
prefer to call it a pride&mdash;that lifts me out of their
reach. I am of the one aristocracy that is truly exclusive,
the only one that needs no artificial barriers
to keep it so. But I shall not bore you, gentle reader,
by explaining about it. You are interested only in the
aristocracies of rank and title and wealth that are nothing
but the tawdry realization of the tawdry fancies of
the yokel among his kine and the scullery maid among
her pots. For, who but a tossed-up yokel or scullery
maid would indulge in such vulgarities as sitting upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a gold throne or living in a draughty, cheerless palace
or seeking to make himself more ridiculous by aggravating
his littleness with a title, like the ass in the lion&#8217;s
skin? Did it ever occur to you, gentle reader, that
aristocracy is essentially common, essentially vulgar?
To a large vision the distinction between king and
carpenter, between the man with a million dollars and
the million men with one dollar looks trivial and unimportant.
Only a squat and squinting soul in a cellar
and blinking through the twilight could discover agitating
differences of rank between Fifth Avenue and
Grand Street, between first floor front and attic rear,
between flesh ripening to rot in silk and flesh ripening
to rot in cotton. To an infinitesimal insect an
infinite gulf yawns between the molecules of a razor&#8217;s
edge.</p>

<p>I often found my club a convenience, for in those
busiest days of my financial career I had much private
conferring&mdash;or conspiring, if you choose. Never had
I found it so convenient as when for the first time there
was pain and shrinking at the thought of going home,
of seeing my wife and Margot. My Margot! When
she was a baby how proudly I had wheeled her along
the sidewalks of Passaic in the showy perambulator we
bought for her&mdash;and the twenty-five dollars it cost
loomed mighty big even to Edna. And in Brooklyn,
what happy Sundays Edna and I had had with her,
when I would hire a buggy at the livery stable round
the corner and we would go out for the day to some
Long Island woods; or when we would take her down
to the respectable end of Coney Island to dig in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
sand and to wade after the receding tide. My Margot!
No longer mine; never again to be mine.</p>

<p>One evening I had an appointment at the Amsterdam
with a Western millionaire, Charles Murdock, whom
I had interested in a Canada railway to tap a Hudson
Bay spruce forest. He was having trouble with his
wife and something of it had come out in the afternoon
newspapers. At the last moment his secretary&mdash;who,
by the way, afterwards married the divorced Mrs. Murdock&mdash;telephoned
that Murdock could not keep his engagement
to dine. I looked about for some one to
help me eat the dinner I had ordered. There are never
many disengaged men in the Amsterdam. The fashionable
rich come only when they have business with the
pariahs. The pariahs prefer their own houses or the
barrooms and caf&eacute;s of the big hotels. I therefore
thought myself lucky when I found Bob Armitage
sulking in a huge leather chair and got him to share
my dinner. Armitage was one of my railway directors.
He had helped me carry through the big stroke that
made me, had joined in half a dozen of my enterprises
in all of which I had been successful. There was no
man of my acquaintance I knew and liked so well as
Armitage. Yet it had so happened that we had never
talked much with each other, except about business.</p>

<p>It promised to be a silent dinner. He was as deep
in his thoughts as I was in mine&mdash;and our faces showed
that neither of us was cogitating anything cheerful.
On impulse I suddenly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob, do you know about fashionable New York
society?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>I knew that he did; that is to say, I had often
heard he was one of the heavy swells, having all three
titles to fashion&mdash;wealth, birth, and marriage. But I
now pretended ignorance of the fact; when you wish
to inform yourself thoroughly on a subject you should
always select an expert, tell him you know nothing and
bid him enlighten you from the alphabet up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221; said Armitage. &#8220;Do you
want to get in? I had a notion you didn&#8217;t care for
society&mdash;you and your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armitage didn&#8217;t go to Holy Cross, but to St. Bartholomew&#8217;s.
So he had never known of my wife&#8217;s activities,
knew only the sort of man I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;You&#8217;ve a daughter
almost grown. I suppose you want her looked after.
All right. I&#8217;ll attend to it for you. Your wife won&#8217;t
mind my wife&#8217;s calling? I&#8217;d have sent her long ago&mdash;in
fact, I apologize for not having done it. But I
hate the fashionable crowd. They bore me. However,
your wife may like them. Women usually do.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at my lips to thank him and decline his
offer. Then it flashed into my mind that perhaps my
one hope of getting back my wife and daughter, of
restoring them to sanity, lay in letting them have what
they wanted. Another sort of man might have deluded
himself with the notion that he could set his foot down,
stamp out revolt, compel his family to do as he willed.
But I happen not to be of that instinctively tyrannical
and therefore inherently stupid temperament.</p>

<p>Armitage ate in silence for a few moments, then
said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have you elected to the Federal Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This club is all I need,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He smiled sardonically. I didn&#8217;t understand that
smile then, because I didn&#8217;t know anything about caste
in New York. &#8220;You let me look after you,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a child in the social game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no objection to remaining so,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right. There&#8217;s nothing in it,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But you must remember you&#8217;re living in a world of
rather cheap fools, and they are impressed by that
nothing. On the other side of the Atlantic the social
prizes have a large substantial value. Over here the
value&#8217;s small. Still it&#8217;s something. You wouldn&#8217;t refuse
even a trading stamp, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;I refuse nothing,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I take
whatever&#8217;s offered me. If I find I don&#8217;t want it, why,
what&#8217;s easier than to throw it away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll put you in the Federal Club. You could
have made me do it, if you had happened to want it.
So, why shouldn&#8217;t I do it anyhow, in appreciation
of your forbearance? You don&#8217;t realize, but I&#8217;m
doing for you what about two thirds of the members
of this club would lick my boots to get me to do
for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea the taste for shoe polish was so general
here,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a human taste, my dear Loring,&#8221; replied he.
&#8220;It&#8217;s as common as the taste for bread. All the men
have it. As for the women they like nothing so well.
Having one&#8217;s boots licked is the highest human joy.
Next comes licking boots.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe that?&#8221; said I, for his tone was
almost too bitter for jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t acquainted with your kind, old man,&#8221;
retorted he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the kind you know,&#8221; said I. And
then I remembered my wife and my daughter. There
must be truth in what Armitage had said; for, my
beautiful wife and my sweet daughter, both looking
so proud&mdash;surely they could not be rare exceptions
in their insensibility to what seemed to me elemental
self-respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know your kind,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;because
you don&#8217;t indulge in cringing and don&#8217;t encourage it.
You&#8217;re like the cold, pure-minded woman who goes
through the world imagining it a chaste and austere
place because her very face silences and awes sensuality.
You are part of the small advance guard of a race that
is to come.&#8221; He grinned satirically. &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll
drop out in the next few months. We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the silence was again broken, it was broken
by me. &#8220;Do you know a school kept by a woman named
Ryper?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do,&#8221; replied he. He gave me a shrewd
laughing glance. &#8220;The daughter isn&#8217;t learning anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but mischief,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Ryper&#8217;s for. But what does it matter?
Why should a woman learn anything? They&#8217;re
of no consequence. The less a man has to do with them
the better off he will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re of the highest consequence,&#8221; said I bitterly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
&#8220;They have the control of the coming generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a hell of a generation it&#8217;s to be,&#8221; cried he,
suddenly rousing from the state of bored apathy in
which he seemed to pass most of his time. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
me started on the subject that&#8217;s a craze with me. I
have only one strong feeling&mdash;and that is my contempt
for woman&mdash;the American woman. I&#8217;m not speaking
about the masses. They don&#8217;t count. They never did.
They never will. No one counts until he gets some education
and some property. I suppose the women of
the masses do as well as could be expected. But how
about the women of the classes with education and property?
Do you know why the world advances so slowly?&mdash;why
the upper classes are always tumbling back and
everything has to be begun all over again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a suspicion,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Because the men are
fools about the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sex question!&#8221; cried Armitage. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the only question worth agitating about. Until it&#8217;s
settled&mdash;or begins to be settled&mdash;and settled right, it&#8217;s
useless to attempt anything else. The men climb up.
The women they take on their backs become a heavier
and heavier burden&mdash;and down they both drop&mdash;and
the children with them. Selfish, vain, extravagant mothers,
crazy about snobbishness, bringing up their children
in extravagance, ignorance and snobbishness&mdash;that&#8217;s
America to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men are fools about the women, and they let
the women make fools of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men are fools&mdash;but not about the women,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
said Armitage. &#8220;How much time and thought for
your family have you averaged daily in the last ten
years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been busy,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to look out
for the bread and butter, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; exclaimed he, in triumph. &#8220;You
think you&#8217;re fond of your family. No doubt you are.
But the bottom truth is you&#8217;re indifferent to your family.
I can prove it in a sentence: You attend to anything
you care about; and you haven&#8217;t attended to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared at him like a man dazzled by a sudden
light&mdash;which, in fact, I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guilty or not guilty?&#8221; said he, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guilty,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American man, too busy to be bothered,
turns the American woman loose&mdash;gives her absolute
freedom. And what is she? A child in education, a
child in experience, a child in taste. He turns her
loose, bids her do as she likes&mdash;and, up to the limit of
his ability gives her all the money she wants. He prefers
her a child. Her childishness rests his tired brain.
And he doesn&#8217;t mind if she&#8217;s a little mischievous&mdash;that
makes her more amusing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are married&mdash;have children,&#8221; said I, too
serious to bother about tact. &#8220;How is it with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed cynically. &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of my family,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I tried the other way. But I&#8217;ve given
up&mdash;several years ago. What can <i>one</i> do in a crazy
crowd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; confessed I, deeply depressed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;The women stampede each other,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;Besides, no American woman&mdash;none that I know&mdash;has
been brought up with education enough to enable
her to make a life for herself, even when the man tries
to help her. To like an occupation, to do anything
at it, you&#8217;ve got to understand it. Being a husband
and father is an occupation, the most important one
in the world for a man. Being a wife and mother is
an occupation&mdash;the most important one in the world
for a woman. Are American men and women brought
up to those occupations&mdash;trained in them&mdash;prepared
for them? The most they know is a smatter at the
pastime of lover and mistress&mdash;and they&#8217;re none too
adept at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that in my whole life I&#8217;ve
never learned so much in so short a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll do you no good to have learned,&#8221; rejoined
Armitage. &#8220;It will only make you sad or bitter, according
to your mood. Or, perhaps some day you
may reach my plane of indifference&mdash;and be amused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing is hopeless,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American woman is hopeless,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Her vanity is triple-plated, copper-riveted. She&#8217;s
hopeless so long as the American man will give her the
money to buy flattery at home and abroad; for, so long
as you can buy flattery, you never find out the truth
about yourself. And the American man will give her
the money as long as he can, because it buys him peace
and freedom. He doesn&#8217;t want to be bothered with the
American woman&mdash;except when he&#8217;s in a certain mood
that doesn&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;There are exceptions,&#8221; said I&mdash;not clear as to
what I meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;there are exceptions,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There
are American men who spend time with the American
woman. And what does she do to them? Look at the
poor asses!&mdash;neglecting their business, letting their
minds go to seed. They don&#8217;t make her wise. She
makes them foolish&mdash;as foolish as herself&mdash;and her
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may perhaps imagine into what a state this
talk of Armitage&#8217;s threw me. He was talking generalities.
But every word he spoke went straight home to
me. He had torn the coverings from my inmost family
life, had exposed its soul, naked and ugly, to my fascinated
gaze.</p>

<p>He finished dinner, lighted a cigarette&mdash;sat back
watching me with a mysterious smile, half amused,
wholly sympathetic, upon his handsome face, younger
than his forty-five years&mdash;for he was considerably
older than I. I was hardly more than barely conscious
of that look of his, or of his presence. Suddenly I
struck my fist with violence upon the arm of my chair.
And I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> do something! It is <i>not</i> hopeless!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly, at the same time exhaling
a cloud of smoke. &#8220;I tried, Godfrey,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and I had a better chance of success than you could
possibly have. For my wife had been brought up by a
sensible father and mother in a sensible way, and she
had been used to fashionable society all her life and,
when I married her, seemed to have proved herself immune.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
A few years and&mdash;&#8221; His cynical smile may
not have been genuine. &#8220;She leads the simpletons.
But you&#8217;ll see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you know what to do, and feel as you do,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;why did you suggest our going into your
society?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t mine,&#8221; laughed he. &#8220;It&#8217;s my wife&#8217;s. It
doesn&#8217;t belong to the men. It belongs to the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Into your wife&#8217;s society?&#8221; persisted I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did I suggest it? Because I wished to
please you, and I know you like to please your wife.
And she&#8217;s an American woman&mdash;therefore, society
mad. She has her daughter at the Ryper joint, hasn&#8217;t
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat morosely silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now! Cheer up!&#8221; cried he, with laughing
irony. &#8220;After all, you can&#8217;t blame the American
woman. She has no training for the career of woman.
She has no training for any serious career. She&#8217;s got
to do something, hasn&#8217;t she? Well, what is there open
to her but the career of lady? That doesn&#8217;t call for
brains or for education or for taste. The dressmaker
and milliner supply the toilet. The architect and decorator
and housekeeper and staff supply the grand background.
Father or husband supplies the cash. A dip
into a novel or book of culture essays supplies the gibble-gabble.
A nice easy profession, is lady&mdash;and universally
admired and envied. No, Loring, it isn&#8217;t fair
to blame her.&#8221;</p>

<p>We strolled down Fifth Avenue. After he had
watched the stream of elegant carriages and automobiles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
some of the too elegant automobiles having their
interiors brightly lighted that the passersby might not
fail to see the elaborate toilets of the occupants&mdash;after
he had observed this procession of extravagance and
vanity, with only an occasional derisive laugh or
&#8220;Look there! Don&#8217;t miss that lady!&#8221; he burst out
again in his pleasantly ironical tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;How fat the women are getting!&mdash;the automobile
women! And how the candy shops are multiplying.
Candy and automobiles!&mdash;and culture. Let us not forget
culture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said I grimly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not forget
the culture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was telling my wife yesterday,&#8221; said Armitage,
&#8220;what culture is. It is talking in language that means
nothing about things that mean less than nothing. But
watch the ladies stream by, all got up in their gorgeous
raiment and jewels. What have they ever done,
what are they doing, that entitles them to so much more
than their poor sisters scuffling along on the sidewalk
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve talked and are talking about culture,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;And don&#8217;t forget charity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;charity!&#8221; cried he gayly. &#8220;Thank you. I
see we understand each other.&#8221; He linked his arm affectionately
in mine. &#8220;Charity! It&#8217;s the other half
of a lady&#8217;s occupation. Charity! Having no fancy
for attending to her own business, she meddles in the
business of the poor, tempting them to become liars
and paupers. Your fine lady is a professional patronizer.
She has no usefulness to contribute to the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
So, she patronizes&mdash;the arts with her culture&mdash;the
poor with her charity, and the human race with her
snobbishness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so amused by his train of thought that he
lapsed into silence the more fully to enjoy it; for, every
thought has its shadings that cannot be expressed in
words yet give the keenest enjoyment. When he spoke
again, it was to repeat:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what have these ladies done to entitle them
to this luxury? Are they, perchance, being paid for
giving to the world, and for inspiring, the noble sons
and daughters who drive coaches and marry titles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do we men do? What do <i>I</i> do&mdash;that
entitles me to so much more than that chap perched
on the hansom? I often think of it. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; laughed Armitage. &#8220;I never claw my
own sore spots. There&#8217;s no fun in that. Always claw
the other fellow&#8217;s. There&#8217;s a laugh and distraction for
your own troubles in seeing him wince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that why you&#8217;ve been clawing mine?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>We were pausing before his big house, at the corner
of the Avenue. &#8220;If I have been I didn&#8217;t know it,&#8221;
said he. He glanced up at his windows with a satirical
smile. &#8220;This evening I&#8217;ve been breaking my rule and
clawing at my own.&#8221; He put out his hand. &#8220;Let the
social business take its course,&#8221; advised he with impressive
friendliness. &#8220;You and I can&#8217;t make the world
over. To fight against the inevitable merely increases
everyone&#8217;s discomfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>I agreed with his conclusion that it was best to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
things alone, though I reached that conclusion by a
different route. I had in mind my forlorn hope of good
results from a homeopathic treatment. I saw how impossible
it was to undo the practically completed training
of a grown girl. I appreciated the absurdity of
an attempt radically to change Edna&#8217;s character&mdash;an
absurdity as great as an attempt to make her a foot
taller or to alter the color of her eyes. The one hope,
it seemed to me&mdash;and I still think I was right&mdash;was
that, when they had social position, when there should
no longer be excuse for fretting lest some one were
thinking them common, they might calm down toward
some sort of sanity.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, please, that at the time I did not
have the situation, nor any idea of it, and of how to
deal with it, definitely and clearly in mind. I was
groping, was seeing dimly, was not even sure that I
saw at all. I was like a thousand other busy American
men who, after years of absorption in affairs, are
abruptly and rudely awakened to the fact that there
is something wrong at home where they had been flattering
themselves everything was all right.</p>

<p>The things Armitage had said occupied my mind,
almost to the exclusion of my business. The longer
I revolved them, the better I understood the situation
at home. I could not but wonder what wretched catastrophe
in his domestic life had made him so insultingly
bitter against women. I felt that he was unfair to
them; any judgment that condemned a class for possessing
universal human weakness must be unfair. At
the same time I believed he had excuse for being unfair&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
excuse of a man whose domestic life is in
ruins. I began to see toward the bottom of the woman
question&mdash;the nature and the cause of the crisis
through which women were passing.</p>

<p>The modern world, as I had read history enough
to know, had suddenly and completely revolutionized
the conditions of life. The male sex, though poorly
where at all equipped to meet the new conditions, still
was compelled to meet them after a fashion. A river
that for ages has moved quietly along in a deep bed,
all in a night swells to many times its former size and
plays havoc with the surrounding country. That was
a fairly good figure for the new life science and machinery
had suddenly forced upon the human race.
The men living in the inundated region&mdash;where floods
were unknown, where appliances, even ideas for combating
them did not exist&mdash;the men, hastily, hysterically,
incompetently, but with resolution and persistence,
because forced by dire necessity, would proceed
to deal with that vast new river. Just so were the men
of our day dealing with the life of steam and electricity,
of ancient landmarks of religion and morality swept
away or shifted, of ancient industrial and social relations
turned upside down and inside out. The men
were coping with the situation after a fashion. But
the women?</p>

<p>These unfortunate creatures, faced with the new
conditions, were in their greater ignorance and incapacity
and helplessness, trying to live as if nothing
had occurred!&mdash;as if the old order still existed. And
the men, partly through ignorance, partly through preoccupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
with the new order, partly through indifference
and contempt veiled as consideration for the
weaker sex, were encouraging them in their fatal folly.
Was it strange that the women were deceived, remained
unconscious of their peril? No, it was on the contrary
inevitable. When men, though working away under
and at the new conditions, still talked as if the old conditions
prevailed, when preachers still preached that
way, and orators still eulogized the thing that was
dead and buried as if it lived and reigned, when in order
to find out the change you had to disregard the
speech, the professions, the confident assertions of all
mankind and observe closely their actions only&mdash;when
there was this universal unawareness and unpreparedness,
how could the poor women be condemned?</p>

<p>I could not but admit to myself that in his account
of the doings of the women Armitage was only slightly
if at all exaggerating. But with my more judicial
temperament that had won me fortune and leadership
while hardly more than a youth, I could not join him
in damning the women for their folly and idleness and
uselessness.</p>

<p>So, the immediate result of Armitage&#8217;s talk was a
gentler and thoroughly tolerant frame of mind toward
my wife, both as to herself and as to what she had done
to our daughter. After all, I had for wife only the
typical woman&mdash;and a rarely sweet and charming example
of the type. And my daughter was no worse,
perhaps was better, than the average girl of her age
and position. What did I think I had&mdash;or ought to
have&mdash;in the way of wife and daughter, anyhow?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
What was this vague, sentimental dream of family life?
If I were by some magic to find myself possessed of the
sort of family I thought I wanted, wouldn&#8217;t I be more
dissatisfied than at present? When I had a wife and
a daughter who <i>looked</i> so well and did nothing but
what everyone around me regarded as right and
proper, was I not unjust in my discontent?</p>

<p>I had not seen Edna or Margot for several days before
my talk with Bob Armitage. I did not see Edna
for several days afterwards, though I dined at home
every evening and did not go out after dinner. I was
debating how to make overtures toward a reconciliation
when she came into my study. She had an air of
coldness and constraint&mdash;the air of the woman who is
inflicting severe punishment upon an offending husband
by withholding herself from him. She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Robert Armitage has asked me to dine on
Thursday evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>I replied hesitatingly: &#8220;Thursday&mdash; I&#8217;ve an engagement
for Thursday&mdash;a dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her agitation she did not note that I had not
finished. Dropping her coldness, she flashed out
fiercely:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve simply <i>got</i> to accept! It&#8217;s our chance.
We may not have it again. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been waiting
for ever since we moved to this house. And I can&#8217;t go
alone. Oh, how selfish you are! You never think of
anything but your own comfort. And you can&#8217;t or
won&#8217;t realize any of the higher things of life for which
I&#8217;m striving. It is too horrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>If any male reader of this story has known a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
woman who was, up to a certain time, always able to
rouse a strong emotion in him&mdash;of love or anger, of
pleasure or pain&mdash;a woman toward whom he could not
be lukewarm, and if that reader can recall the day on
which he faced that woman in a situation of stress and
found himself calm and patient and kind toward
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that Edna was not moving
me. Her loveliness did not stir a single tiny flame of
passion. Her abuse did not excite resentment or dread.
&#8220;Just a moment, my dear,&#8221; said I with the tranquillity
of a judge. &#8220;I was trying to say that I would break
my engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that she did not believe me but imagined her
outburst had terrified and cowed me into submission.
How dispassionately I observed and judged!</p>

<p>&#8220;Accept, if you wish,&#8221; I went on. &#8220;I like Armitage.
We&#8217;ve been friends for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me so?&#8221; demanded she.
&#8220;Why have you been plotting against me all this
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forbade me to speak of business,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;So I have never spoken of my business friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her anger against me was almost beyond control.
If she had been a lady born, if she had not had a past
to live down, a childhood of vulgar surroundings and
actions, she would have given way and abused like a
fish wife. A lady born dares excesses of passion that
a made lady, with her deep reverence for the ladylike,
would shrink from. She said through clinched teeth:</p>

<p>&#8220;I find out that Mrs. Armitage, the leader of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
younger set, the most fashionable woman in New York,
has been eager to know me for a long time. And <i>you</i>
have been preventing it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; said I, amused, but not showing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She called here the other day. She was as friendly
as could be. We became friends at once. She said
that for months she had been at her husband to get
her leave to call on me, but that he and you, between
you, had neglected to arrange it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw how this notion of the matter delighted her,
and that the truth would enrage her, would make her
dislike me more than ever. So, I held my peace and
thought, for the first time, I believe, how tiresome a
woman without a sense of humor could become&mdash;how
tryingly tiresome.</p>

<p>&#8220;She and I are going to do a lot of things together,&#8221;
continued Edna in the same intense humorless
way. &#8220;I always knew that if I got a chance to talk
with one of those women who could appreciate me, I&#8217;d
have no further trouble. I knew I was wasting time
on those religious fakirs and frumps, but I was always
hoping that through them I&#8217;d somehow meet a woman
of my own sort. Now I&#8217;ve met her, and something tells
me I&#8217;ll have no further trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;How it infuriates me,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;to think
I&#8217;d have been spared all the humiliations and heartaches
I&#8217;ve suffered, if you had used your influence with
Robert Armitage months&mdash;years ago. But no&mdash;you
don&#8217;t want me to get on. You wanted to stick in the
mud. So I had to suffer&mdash;and Margot, too.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all right now,&#8221; said I, probably as indifferently
as I felt. Why had God seen fit to create
women without the sense of humor? Perhaps to
save men from falling altogether under their rule.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sufferings of that poor child!&#8221; cried Edna.
&#8220;And the very day after Mrs. Armitage came, Gracie
Fortescue asked her to a party, and all the girls have
taken her up. Gracie Fortescue is a niece of Hilda
Armitage. Her brother married a Fortescue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said I. &#8220;And Margot is happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No thanks to you,&#8221; retorted Edna sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, plunge in, my dear,&#8221; said I, beginning to examine
the papers before me on the desk. &#8220;Only&mdash;spare
me as much as possible. I need all my time and strength
for my work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have to go with me to dinners, and to
the opera occasionally. I can&#8217;t do this thing altogether
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say I&#8217;m an invalid. Say I&#8217;m away. They don&#8217;t
want me, anyhow. Armitage doesn&#8217;t go with his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s different,&#8221; cried she in a fever. &#8220;<i>She</i>
has always had social position. It doesn&#8217;t matter if
people do talk scandal about her. <i>I</i> can&#8217;t afford to
cause gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should they gossip? But no matter. I
don&#8217;t want to worry with that&mdash;that higher life, let us
call it. Or to be worried with it. Do the best you
can for me. I&#8217;m a man&#8217;s man&mdash;always have been&mdash;always
shall be. If you&#8217;ve got to have a man to take
you about, dig up one somewhere. I&#8217;m willing to pay
him well.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;Always money!&#8221; exclaimed she in deep disgust.</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;Not a bad thing, money,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would never have got me Mrs. Armitage&#8217;s
friendship,&#8221; said she loftily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; said I amiably. &#8220;All right, if
it pleases you. But&mdash;take my advice, my dear&mdash;enjoy
yourself to the limit with highfaluting <i>talk</i> about the
worthlessness of money and that sort of rot. But don&#8217;t
for a minute lose your point of view and convince
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God I&#8217;ve got a vein of refinement, of idealism
in my nature,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have as
sordid an opinion of human nature as you have for anything
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can afford not to have it, my dear,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;So long as I know the truth, and so make the necessary
money to keep us going, you are free to indulge
your lovely delusions. Have your beautiful, unmercenary
friendship with Mrs. Armitage and the other
ladies. I&#8217;ll continue to make it financially worth their
husbands&#8217; while to encourage the friendships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;You believe Mrs.
Armitage has taken me up for business reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been some poor woman&mdash;&#8221; I began
mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd!&#8221; cried my wife. &#8220;How could
there be an equal and true friendship between Mrs.
Armitage and a woman with none of the surroundings
of a lady, and with no means of gratifying the tastes
of a lady? But that doesn&#8217;t mean that Mrs. Armitage
is a low, sordid woman. She has a beautiful nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Money is merely the background of high society. It
simply gives ladies and gentlemen the opportunity to
set the standards of dress and manners and taste. And
of course they&#8217;re careful whom they associate with.
Who wants to be annoyed by adventurers and climbers
and all sorts of dreadful mercenary, self-seeking
people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, indeed?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>It gently appealed to my sense of the ridiculous, to
see my wife thus changed in a twinkling into a defender
and exponent of fashionable society. It was so deliciously
feminine, as fantastically humorless, her sincere
belief in the poppycock she was reeling off&mdash;the twaddle
with which Mrs. Armitage had doubtless stuffed her.
The sordidness, the vulgarity, the meanness, the petty
cruelty, the snobbishness of fashionable people&mdash;all forgotten
in a moment, hastily covered deep with the gilt
and the tinsel of hypocritical virtues. What an amusing
ass the human animal is! How stupidly unconscious
of its own motives! How eagerly it attributes to
itself all kinds of high motives for the ordinary, or
scrubby, or downright mean actions&mdash;and attributes
the same motives to its fellow asses, to make its own
pretenses the more plausible! An amusing ass&mdash;but it
would be more amusing if it were not so monotonously
solemn, but laughed at itself occasionally.</p>

<p>However&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The atmosphere of our home now steadily improved.
The servants began to respect us, where they had despised
and had scarcely troubled themselves to conceal
their contempt. The cook sent up more attractive&mdash;though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
I fear even less digestible&mdash;dishes. The butler
addressed me with a gratifying servility. The maids
developed unexpected talents, showing acquaintance with
the needs and customs of a fashionable household. The
housekeeper&#8217;s soul dropped from its theretofore insolently
erect posture to all fours, and she attended to
her duties. Edna became sweet and gracious. Margot
grew merry and affectionate. All the result of Mrs.
Armitage. We had been pariahs; we were of the elect.</p>

<p>I saw and felt the change distinctly at the time.
But it is only in retrospect that I take the full measure&mdash;get
its full humor&mdash;and pathos.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That Armitage dinner was <i>the</i> event of Edna&#8217;s life.
She had been born; she had married; she had given
birth&mdash;all memorable and important occurrences. But
this formal d&eacute;but in fashionable society topped them
as the peak tops the foothills. Having seen her quivering
and hysterical excitement when we were leaving
the house, I feared a breakdown. I marveled at her
apparent calmness and ease as we entered the dining
room of the Armitages. Never had she looked so well.
If Mrs. Armitage had not been a self-satisfied beauty
of the dark type she might have demolished Edna&#8217;s
dream in its very realizing. But no doubt Edna, the
shrewd, had duly measured Hilda Armitage and had discovered
that it was safe to make her proud of the woman
she had taken under protection and patronage.</p>

<p>There were but a dozen people in all at the dinner.
It did not seem to be much of an affair. The drawing-room
was plain&mdash;nothing gaudy, nothing costly looking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Our own dining room was much grander&mdash;to our
then uneducated taste. The guests were&mdash;just people&mdash;simple,
good-natured mortals, perfectly at their ease
and putting us at our ease. You would have wondered,
after five minutes of that company, how anyone could
possibly find any difficulty in getting intimately acquainted
with them. But, as Edna knew at a glance,
she and I were in the midst of the innermost and smallest
circle of the many circles one within another that
make up New York fashionable society. If on the
recommendation of the Armitages we should have the
good fortune to be accepted by that circle of circles,
that circle within the circles, there would be nothing
of a social nature left for us to conquer in New York.
I was ignorant of all this at the time; had I known,
I imagine I should have remained tranquil. But Edna
knew at a glance; she had been studying these matters
for years. It shows what force of character she had
that she conducted herself as if it were the most ordinary
and familiar occasion of her life. She had always
said, even away back in the days of the grand forty-dollars-a-month
flat in Passaic, that she belonged at
the social top. She was undoubtedly right. The way
she acted when she arrived there proved it.</p>

<p>You do not often have the chance, gentle reader, to
get so well acquainted with any human being as I have
enabled you to get with Edna. Probably you do not
even know yourself so well. Therefore I suspect that
you have a wholly false notion of her&mdash;think her in
every way much worse relatively than she was. Through
your novels and through the reports your dim eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
bring to your narrow and shallow mind, you have acquired
certain habits of judging your fellow beings.</p>

<p>You attach inflated importance to their unimportant
surface qualities&mdash;physical appearance, pleasant voice
and manner&mdash;and to their amiable little hypocrisies of
apparent sweetness and generosity and friendliness.
You do not see the real person&mdash;the human being. You,
being by training a hypocrite and a believer in hypocrisies,
scorn human beings. Now I prefer them to the
sort of people with whom you and your false literature
populate the world. In making you acquainted with
Edna&mdash;and the others in my story&mdash;I have not introduced
you to bad people, monsters, but to real beings
of usual types, probably on the whole superior to your
smug self in all the good qualities. Had you seen Edna
in the Armitage house that evening you would have
thought her as incapable of calculation and snobbishness
as&mdash;well, as any of the others in that company
whose whole lives were made up of calculation and snobbishness.
She&mdash;and they&mdash;looked so refined and elevated.
She&mdash;and they&mdash;talked so high-mindedly. I,
who knew almost nothing at that time except business,
was listener rather than talker; and you may be sure
such a man as I, having such ignorance as mine to cover
up, had in years of practice become somewhat adept in
that saving art for the intelligent ignorant. But
Edna&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She, the most expert of smatterers, fairly shone.
With her beauty and vivacity, her eloquent eyes and
dazzling smile, and exquisite bare shoulders, to aid her,
she created an impression of brilliancy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;You had a good time?&#8221; said I, when we were in the
motor for the home journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never had as good a time in my life,&#8221; she exclaimed,
her voice tremulous with ecstasy. &#8220;Did I look
well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never so well,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And you made a hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was careful to cultivate the women,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got them,&#8221; I declared sincerely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure I didn&#8217;t make some of them jealous?
Did you see any signs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They liked you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to play my cards well,&#8221; pursued she. &#8220;It
was a difficult position. I was far and away the best
looking woman there, with the possible exception of
Mrs. Armitage. Did you hear her call me Edna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Mrs. Armitage look well together. You
are of about the same figure, and the contrast of coloring
is very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we took to each other so quickly.
Each of us sets off the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you like Armitage?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well enough,&#8221; said she indifferently. &#8220;I
hardly noticed him&mdash;or the other men. I had my game
to play. The men don&#8217;t count in the social game. It&#8217;s
the women. I shall be nervous until I find out whether
I really got them. They are such cats!&mdash;so mean and
sly and jealous. I <i>detest</i> women!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer men, myself,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men!&#8221; She laughed scornfully. &#8220;I think men
are intolerable&mdash;American men. They say foreigners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
are better. But American men&mdash;they know nothing
but dull business or politics. They have no breadth&mdash;no
idealism. The women are far superior to the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;No doubt you women are too good
for us,&#8221; said I carelessly. &#8220;We&#8217;re grateful that you
don&#8217;t scorn us too much even to accept our money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How coarse that is! Don&#8217;t spoil the happiest
evening of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were at home, so she could escape from me.
And I, for my part, was as glad to be quit of her society
as she could possibly have been to get rid of me.
I was beginning to realize that her conversation bored
me, that it had always bored me, that it was her sex
and only her sex that interested me. And latterly even
this had lost its charm. Why?</p>

<p>I have observed&mdash;and perhaps you have observed it,
too&mdash;that people of wealth and position, unless they
have very striking individuality indeed, are usually utterly
devoid of charm. It is difficult to become interested
in them, to establish any sort of sympathetic current.
And you will notice that fashionable functions are dull,
essentially dull; that the animation is artificial, is supplied
from without by an orchestra or entertainers, and
fails to infect the company. It was long before I discovered
the explanation for this. I at first thought it
was the stupidity that comes from a surfeit of the
luxuries and pleasures. But I am now convinced that
this familiar explanation is not the true one; that the
true one is the excessive, the really preposterous self-centeredness
of people of rank and wealth. From waking
until sleeping they are surrounded by hirelings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
sycophants who think and talk only of them. Thus
the rich man or woman gets into the habit of concentrating
upon self. Now the essence of charm is giving&mdash;giving
oneself out in sympathetic interest in one&#8217;s fellows.
How can people, all whose faculties are trained
to work in upon themselves&mdash;how can they have charm?
An egotist, one who <i>talks</i> only of himself, may have
charm because he gives you the impression that he is
trying to please you, that he thinks you so important
that he wishes you to be sensible of his importance.
But the egotist who, whatever he <i>talks</i>, <i>thinks</i> only of
himself&mdash;he is not only dull and bored but also a diffuser
of dullness and boredom. And that is how their
servants and their sycophants make the rich and the
fashionable so dreary.</p>

<p>I imagine some such effect as this was being produced
upon my wife by her surroundings of luxury. I
think that may account for her long decreasing charm
for me. At any rate, soon after she was well launched
on her Elysian sea of fashion&mdash;that is to say, soon
after she ceased to have any check of social seeking to
restrain her from centering all her thoughts and actions
upon herself, she lost the last bit of her charm for me.
She became radiantly beautiful. Her face took on a
serene and refinedly assured expression that made her
extravagantly admired on every hand. She became
gracious to me and almost as sweet as she had been
before we moved to New York. She even let me see
that, if I so desired, she would condescend to be on
terms of wifely affection with me again. But I did
not so desire. I liked her. I admired her energy, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
toilets, and, quite impersonally, her aristocratic beauty.
But I was content to be a bachelor, and I was grateful
when she began to relieve me of the tediousness of going
about in her train.</p>

<p>My substitute was an architect, Leon MacIlvane by
name&mdash;a handsome young fellow of about my wife&#8217;s age,
though he thought her much younger, despite Margot&#8217;s
age and appearance. With his poetic dark eyes and
classic features, and rich, deep voice, MacIlvane had
long been a favorite with the young married women of
the Armitage set. He was indeed a valuable asset. The
rich unmarried men were not especially interesting;
also, they were needed by the marriageable girls. MacIlvane,
not a marrying man and never making any
mother uneasy by so much as an interested glance at
a daughter intended for a rich husband, devoted himself
to married women.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care for girls,&#8221; he said to me. &#8220;They
are too colorless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why bother with women at all?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
they all colorless? What do they know about life?
What experience have they had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An intelligent woman&#8217;s mind is the complement of
an intelligent man&#8217;s mind,&#8221; said he, as if this trite old
fallacy were a brilliant discovery of his own making.
&#8220;Women stimulate me, give me ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said I practically. &#8220;Business. Yes,
an architect does deal chiefly with the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; said he, showing as much
anger as he dared show the husband of the woman to
whom he had attached himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the harm in it?&#8221; said I encouragingly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to make a living&mdash;haven&#8217;t you?
It&#8217;s good sense for a business man to cultivate his
customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He, the poseur and the small man, hated this plain
truthful way of dealing with his profession. Like all
chaps of that kidney he thought only of himself and of
appearances, and sought to degrade a noble profession
to the base uses of his vanity. In fact, he had begun
with my wife because of the orders he hoped to get&mdash;for,
he suspected that once she looked about her in the
fashionable world from the new viewpoint of a fashionable
person, she would want changes in her house to
make it less vividly grand. He believed she would let
Hilda Armitage educate her; and Hilda, unlike most of
her friends, liked the quiet kinds of ostentation and costliness.
And he guessed correctly. He was well paid
for undertaking to replace me as escort&mdash;so far as I
could be replaced without causing scandal&mdash;and, thank
heaven, that was very far in the New York of busy and
bored husbands, detesting the gaudy gaddings their
wives loved.</p>

<p>Soon he was serving my wife for other reasons than
pay. I saw something of him from time to time, and I
presently began to note a change in his manner toward
me&mdash;a formal politeness, an exaggeration of courtesy.
I spoke to Armitage about it. Armitage and I had become
the most intimate of friends&mdash;knocked about together
in the evenings, were more closely associated than
ever in business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; said I to Armitage, &#8220;what ails that ass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
MacIlvane? He treats me as if he were in love with
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armitage laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My
wife&#8217;s spaniel, Courtleigh, who writes poetry, treats me
the same way. Get any anonymous letters yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Servants,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I suppose you burnt them?
You didn&#8217;t show them to your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, no,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Why unsettle her?
Why upset a pleasant arrangement? My wife finds
MacIlvane useful. I find him invaluable. He saves me
hours of time. He spares me hours of boredom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My feeling about Courtleigh,&#8221; said Armitage.
&#8220;And both those chaps are comfortably trustworthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of MacIlvane in that way,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;I know my wife&mdash;and that&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armitage reflected with an amused smile on his face.
Finally, he said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose there ever were since
the world began so thoroughly trustworthy women as
these American women of the fashionable crowd&mdash;those
that have very rich husbands&mdash;and only those, of course,
are really fashionable. They may flirt a little, but
never anything serious&mdash;never anything that&#8217;d give
their husbands an excuse for throwing them out&mdash;and
lose them their big houses and big incomes and social
leadership.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had not thought of these aspects of the matter. I
based my feeling of security solely on my knowledge of
my wife&#8217;s intense self-absorption. All the springs of
sentiment&mdash;except the shallow spring of highfaluting
talk&mdash;had dried up in her. She would listen to MacIlvane&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
flatteries as long as he cared to pour them out.
But if he ever tried to get her to think of <i>him</i>, she
would feel outraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; pursued Armitage, &#8220;we&#8217;d be tremendously
amused if we could overhear those chaps talking
to our wives about us. They don&#8217;t dare presume
to the extent of mentioning our names. But
they hand out generalities of roasting&mdash;how stupid
most American men are, how superior the women are,
what a tragic condescension for a wonderful American
woman to have to live with a man who couldn&#8217;t
appreciate her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing a woman loves so much&mdash;an American
woman with a little miseducation befogging her mind
and fooling her as to its limited extent&mdash;nothing she
so dearly loves as to hear that she has a great intellect
and a great soul, complex, mysterious, beyond the comprehension
of the vulgar male clods about her. That&#8217;s
why they like foreigners. You ought to watch those
foreign chaps flatter our women&mdash;make perfect fools
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had no desire to watch women in any circumstances.
I had no active resentment against them as
had Armitage. I simply wished to be let alone, to be
free to pursue my ambitions and my ideas of self-development.
I had ceased to feel about Margot. I was
merely glad she was not a boy; for I felt that if she
were a boy, I should have to assert myself and do some
drastic and disagreeable&mdash;and almost certainly disastrous&mdash;disciplining
in my family.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>About a year and a half after my wife achieved her
ambition, I began to feel that she was spiritually bearing
down upon me in pursuance of some new secret
plan.</p>

<p>During the year and a half she had been playing
the fashionable social game with the strenuous enthusiasm
which only a woman&mdash;I had almost said only an
American woman&mdash;seems able to inject into the pursuit
of objects that are of no consequences whatsoever. And,
in spite of the useful MacIlvane I had been compelled
to assist her far more than was to my liking. I went
about enough to get a thorough insight into fashionableness&mdash;and
a profound distaste for it. Of the many
phases, ludicrous, repellent, despicable, pitiful, there
was one that made a deep impression upon me. It
amazed me to find that the &#8220;best&#8221; class of people was,
if possible, more vulgarly snobbish than the class from
which I had come&mdash;even than the &#8220;Brooklyn bounders.&#8221;
I could not comprehend&mdash;I cannot comprehend&mdash;how
those who have had the best opportunities are no more
intelligent, no broader of mind than those who have had
no opportunities at all. The ignorance, the narrowness
of the men and women of the comfortable classes!&mdash;the
laziness of their minds!&mdash;the shallow cant about literature,
art and the like! Really, intelligence, activity
of mind, seems confined to the few who are pushing
upward; and the masses of mankind in all classes seem
contented each class with its own peculiar wallow of
ignorance.</p>

<p>But to Edna&#8217;s secret plan. If you are a married
man you will at once understand what I mean when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
speak of having a vague sensation of being borne down
upon. She said nothing; she did nothing. But I knew
she was making ready to ask something to which she
believed she could get my consent only by the use of all
her tact and skill and charm&mdash;for she did not know her
charms had ceased to charm, but thought them more
potent than ever. I waited with patience and composure;
and in due time she began cautious open approaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot is almost ready to come out,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money?&#8221; said I, smiling.</p>

<p>She rebuked this coarseness amiably. &#8220;<i>Everybody</i>
isn&#8217;t <i>always</i> thinking of money, dear,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why talk to <i>me</i> about anything else? That&#8217;s
my only department in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>She deigned a smile for my pleasantry, then went
on in her usual serious way: &#8220;I wish to consult you
about her education.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;finish as you&#8217;ve begun,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I suppose
it&#8217;s the best that can be done for a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t find what I want,&#8221; said she, with an
expression of sweet maternal solicitude. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always
been determined Margot should have the best education
any girl in the whole world could get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said I. &#8220;See that she gets it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shall have the perfect equipment of a lady&mdash;of
a woman of the world,&#8221; continued Edna, with
growing enthusiasm. &#8220;She has the beauty to set
it off&mdash;and we can afford to give it to her. I
am willing to make any sacrifices that may be necessary.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>I pricked up my ears. I always do when anyone,
male or female, uses that word sacrifice. I know a piece
of selfishness is coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; pursued Edna, with the serene
look of the self-confident woman who is taking her
husband in firm, strong hands, &#8220;I have been unable to
find what I want for her. Mrs. Armitage tells me I&#8217;ll
not find it except in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;why not go to Paris?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Did you ever lift an empty box that you thought
full and heavy? My wife looked as if she had just
done that exceedingly uncomfortable thing. &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t see&mdash; I&mdash;I&mdash; It would be a terrible sacrifice
to have to go and live in Paris,&#8221; stammered she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must think of Margot!&#8221; exclaimed she
hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Margot seems to be stepping along all right.
She&#8217;ll never miss what she doesn&#8217;t know about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must realize, dear, what an education
she&#8217;d get in Paris. And I suppose it would do me
good, too. It&#8217;s a shame that I don&#8217;t speak French.
Everyone except me speaks it. They all had French
governesses when they were children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them had&mdash;and some hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Armitage has told me things about your friends that
make me suspect they&#8217;re doing fully as much bluffing
as we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>She winced, and sighed the sigh of the lady patient
with a low husband. &#8220;Then you think I ought to go?&#8221;
said she.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;I think you ought to do as you like,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I always have thought so. I always shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued she absently, &#8220;the society over
there must be charming. Really, I need the education
as much as Margot does. I do surprisingly well, considering
what my early opportunities were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never once heard you give yourself away,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not that stupid,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;But&mdash;a while
in France&mdash;on the Continent&mdash;and in England perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long would you be gone?&#8221; interrupted I, to
show her that all this beating round Robin&#8217;s barn was
superfluous.</p>

<p>She gave me a coquettish look: &#8220;How long could
you spare me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell till I&#8217;ve tried,&#8221; said I, with a gallant
smile&mdash;but with no move toward her. You women
who would be wise, distrust the gallantry that is content
with speech and look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand,&#8221; pursued she, &#8220;if I started this
thing I&#8217;d put it through&mdash;no matter how much I
missed you or how homesick I was over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always do put things through,&#8221; said I admiringly.
&#8220;When have you planned to start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t planned at all, as yet,&#8221; replied she&mdash;and
I saw she thought I had set a trap for her, and
was delighted with herself for having dodged it. Certainly
never was there a husband with whom indirection
was more unnecessary. Yet she would not realize this,
partly because she had never bothered to discover what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
manner of man I was, partly because she had one of
those natures that move only by secrecy and indirection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you expect me to go over with you?&#8221; inquired
I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wish you would!&#8221; exclaimed she, but I
distrusted her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t MacIlvane take you over and settle
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face clouded. Her lip curled slightly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like him as I did,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found out
he&#8217;s ridiculously vain and egotistical.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; inquired she, elevating her eyebrows.
She had always disapproved my sense of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s been making love to you&mdash;eh?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; cried she, bridling haughtily.
&#8220;He&#8217;d not dare. But I saw he was beginning to presume
in that direction, and I checked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s harmless,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Keep friendly with
him. He&#8217;d be the very person to settle you in Paris.
He lived there several years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would cause scandal,&#8221; said she. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t
go, I can do well enough alone, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d only be in the way,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Let me know
when you wish to go, and I&#8217;ll try to arrange it. But
I can&#8217;t get away for at least three months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be too late,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Margot
must be started at once. She hasn&#8217;t any too much time
before her coming out. Also, Mrs. Armitage is sailing
in two weeks, and she would be a great help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have decided to sail in two weeks?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
said I, adding before she had time to get beyond a
gathering frown of protest, &#8220;That suits me. I&#8217;ll make
my own plans accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in two weeks they sailed, I watching the big
ship creep out of dock and drop slowly down the river.
Armitage and I drove away from the pier together.
We were in such high spirits that we had champagne
with our lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Armitage</span> and I were together every day. He attracted
me for the usual reason of congeniality, and
also because he was giving me a liberal education. I
have never cared for books or, with two or three exceptions,
for book men. About both there is for me
an atmosphere of staleness, of tedium. I prefer to
get what is in the few worth-while books through the
medium of some clear and original mind&mdash;such a mind
as Armitage had. He ought to have been a great man.
No, he was a great man; what I mean to say is that
his talents ought to have won his greatness recognition.
He did not lack capacity or energy; he showed a high
degree of both in the management and increase of his
fortune. He lacked that species of vanity, I guess it
is, which spurs a man to make himself conspicuous.
Also he had a kind of laziness, and chose to be active
only in the way that was easiest and most agreeable
for him&mdash;the making of money.</p>

<p>His father had been rich, and his grandfather;
his great grandfather had been one of the richest men
in Revolutionary times. His father was regarded as
a crank because he had imagination, and therefore despised
the conventional ideas of his own generation;
to be regarded as thoroughly sane and sensible, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
must be careful to be neither, but to pattern yourself
painstakingly upon the particular form of feeble-mindedness
and conventional silliness current in your time.
Armitage&#8217;s father resolved that his son should not have
his individuality clipped and moulded and patterned
by college and caste into the familiar type of upper-class
man. So Armitage went to public school, graduated
from it into a factory, then into an office, himself
earned the money to carry out the ambitions for
study and travel with which his father had inspired
him.</p>

<p>I think there was nothing worth the knowing about
which Armitage had not accurate essential information&mdash;books,
plays, pictures, music, literature, history,
economics, science, medicine, law, finance. He was a
good shot and a good horseman, could run an automobile,
take it to pieces, put it together again. He was
a practical mechanic and a practical railroad man. He
had a successful model farm. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take long
to learn the essentials about anything,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if
you will only put your whole mind on it and not let
up till you&#8217;ve got what you want. And the trouble
with most people&mdash;why, they are narrow and ignorant
and incompetent&mdash;it isn&#8217;t lack of mind, but lack of interest.
They have no curiosity.&#8221; Nor was my friend
Armitage a smatterer. He didn&#8217;t try to <i>do</i> everything;
he contented himself with knowledge, and <i>did</i> only one
thing&mdash;made money out of railroads.</p>

<p>When he saw that I really wished to be educated, he
amused himself by educating me. Not in a formal
way, of course; but simply talking along, about whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
happened to come up. I have never known a man
to get anywhere, who did not have an excellent memory.
Lack of memory&mdash;which means lack of the habit and
power of giving attention&mdash;is the cause of more failures
than all other defects put together. If you don&#8217;t
believe it, test the failures you know; perhaps you
might even test your own not too successful self. I
had an unusual memory; and I don&#8217;t think Armitage or
anyone ever told me anything worth knowing that I
did not stick to it and keep it where I could use it
instantly.</p>

<p>Several months after his wife and mine departed,
we were walking in the park one afternoon&mdash;the
usual tramp round the upper reservoir to reduce or
to keep in condition. He said in the most casual
way:</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife is coming next week, and will get her
divorce at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking my cue from his manner I showed even less
surprise then I felt. &#8220;This is the first I&#8217;ve heard of
it,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said he carelessly. &#8220;Everyone knows.&#8221;
He laughed to himself. &#8220;She is to marry Lord Blankenship&mdash;the
Earl of Blankenship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the children?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Her
people will look after them. She has spoiled them beyond
repair. I have no interest in them&mdash;nor they in
me.&#8221; After a little tramping in silence, he halted and
rested his hands on the railing and looked away across
the lakelike reservoir, its surface tossed up into white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
caps by the wind. &#8220;I loved her when we were married,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;That caused all the mischief. I let
her do as she pleased. She was a fine girl&mdash;good family
but poor. She pretended to be in sympathy with
my ideas.&#8221; His lip curled in good-humored contempt.
&#8220;I believed in her enthusiasm. My father&mdash;wonderfully
sane old man&mdash;warned me she was only after our
money, but I wouldn&#8217;t listen. Tried to quarrel with
him. He wouldn&#8217;t have it&mdash;gave me my way. It&#8217;s
not strange I believed in her. She looked all that&#8217;s
high-minded&mdash;and delicate&mdash;and what they call aristocratic.
Well, it <i>is</i> aristocratic&mdash;the reality of aristocracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she was sincere,&#8221; said I, out of the depths
of my own experience, &#8220;perhaps she honestly imagined
she liked and wanted the sort of life you pictured. We
are all hypocrites, but most of us are unconscious hypocrites.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt she did deceive herself&mdash;in part at least,&#8221;
he admitted. &#8220;For a year or so after our marriage she
kept up the bluff. I didn&#8217;t catch on&mdash;didn&#8217;t find her
out&mdash;until we began to differ about bringing up the
children. Even then, I loved her so that I let her have
her way until it was too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said I, &#8220;don&#8217;t you owe it to them to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He interrupted with an impatient, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I try?
But it was hopeless. To succeed in this day, I&#8217;d have
had to take the children away off into the woods, with
the chances that even there the servants I&#8217;d be compelled
to have would spoil them&mdash;would keep them reminded of
the rotten snobbishness they&#8217;ve been taught.&#8221; He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
laughed at me with mocking irony. &#8220;You have a
daughter,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What about her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of your boy,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He frowned and looked away. After a long pause&mdash;&#8220;Hopeless&mdash;hopeless,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Believe me&mdash;hopeless. The boy is like her.
No, I&#8217;ll have to begin all over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave an inquiring look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry again,&#8221; explained he. &#8220;Another sort of
woman, and keep her and her children away from this
world of ours. I&#8217;d like to try the experiment. But&mdash;&#8221;
He laughed apologetically. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I love the city
and its amusements too well. I&#8217;m not as determined nor
as ardent as I once was. What does it matter, anyway?
So long as we are comfortable and well amused, why
should we bother?&#8221; After a silence, &#8220;Another mistake
I made&mdash;the initial mistake&mdash;was in giving her a fortune.
She is almost as well fixed as I am. Don&#8217;t make
that mistake, Godfrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already done it,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And I shall never
be sorry that I did. I gave my wife the first large sum
I made, and I&#8217;ve added to it from time to time. I wanted
her and Margot to be safe, no matter what happened
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mistake,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A sad mistake. I know
how you felt. I felt the same way. But there&#8217;s something
worse than the more or less sentimental aversion
to being loved and considered merely for the money they
can get out of you and can&#8217;t get without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing worse,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s worse to give a foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
woman the power to make a fool of herself, of her children,
and of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is bad, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But the other
is worse&mdash;at least to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d refuse to make a child behave itself, through
the selfish fear that it would hate you for doing so.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;You know my weakness, I see,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the foolish American husband and father.
No wonder all the classes that ought to be leaders in
development and civilization are leaders only in luxury
and folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let them have a good time&mdash;what they call a
good time,&#8221; said I. &#8220;As you said a moment ago, it
doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it only were a good time&mdash;to be ignorant and
snobbish and lazy, to drive instead of walking, to eat
and drink instead of thinking, to be waited upon instead
of getting the education and the happiness that
come from serving others. Don&#8217;t laugh at me. After
all, while you and I&mdash;all our sort of men&mdash;are greedy,
selfish grabbers, making thousands work for us, still we
do build up big enterprises, we do set things to moving,
and we do teach men the discipline of regular work by
forcing them to work for us at more or less useful
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt you, gentle reader, have fallen asleep over
this conversation. I understand perfectly that it is beyond
you; for you have no conception of the deep underlying
principles of the relations of men and men or
men and women. But there may be among my readers
a few who will see interest and importance in this talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
with Armitage. It is time the writers of stories concerned
themselves with the realities of life instead of with
the showy and sensational things that obscure or hide
the realities. What would you think of the physiologist
who issued a treatise on physiology with no mention
or account of the blood? Yet you read stories about
what purports to be life with no mention or account of
money&mdash;this, when in any society money is the all-important
factor. Put aside, if you can, the prejudices
of your miseducation and &aelig;sthetics, of your false culture
and your false refinement, open your mind, <i>think</i>,
and you will see that I am right.</p>

<p>When we were well down toward the end of the Park,
Armitage said: &#8220;Pardon me a direct question. Have
you and your wife separated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She has gone abroad to round out
Margot&#8217;s education&mdash;and her own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what that means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a general way,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;I&#8217;m letting them
amuse themselves. They don&#8217;t need me, nor I them.
Perhaps when they come back&mdash;&#8221; I did not finish my
sentence.</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;That means you don&#8217;t really care
what happens when they come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>My smile was an admission of the correctness of his
guess. We dropped our domestic affairs and took up
the matters that were more interesting and more important
to us.</p>

<p>If you have good sight, unimpaired eyes, you go
about assuming&mdash;when you think of it at all&mdash;that good
sight is the rule in the world and impaired eyes the exception.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
But let your sight begin to fail, let your eyes
become darkened, and soon you discover that you are one
of thousands&mdash;that good sight is the exception, that
almost everyone has something the matter with his eyes.
The reason human beings know so little about human
nature, the reason the sentimental flapdoodle about human
virtues, in the present not very far-advanced stage
of human evolution, is so widely believed and doubt of it
so indignantly denounced as cynicism, lies in the fact
that the average human being is ignorant of the afflictions
of his own soul. This would be pleasant and harmless
enough, and to destroy the delusion would be wickedly
cruel, were it not that the only way to cure ailments
of whatever sort is to diagnose them. What hope
is there for the man devoured of a fever who fancies and
insists that he is healthy? What hope is there for the
man who eats pleasant-tasting slow poison under the
impression that it is food? What a quaint notion it is
that the truth, the sole source of health and happiness,
is bad for some people, chiefly for those sick unto death
through the falsehoods of ignorance and vanity! We
humans are like the animal that claws and bites the surgeon
who is trying to set its broken leg.</p>

<p>But I am wandering a little. Discover that you have
any ailment of body or of soul, and you soon discover
how widespread that ailment is. You do not even appreciate
how widespread, incessant, and poignant are the
ravages of death until your own family and friends begin
to die off. I had no notion of the extent of the social
or domestic malady of abandoned husbands and
fathers until I became one of that curious class.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Among the masses there is the great and growing
pestilence of abandoned wives&mdash;husbands, worn out by
the uncertainties of the laboring man&#8217;s income, and disgusted
with the incompetence of their wives and with
the exasperations of the badly brought up children&mdash;such
husbands flying by tens of thousands to escape what
they cannot cure or endure. Among the classes, from
the plutocracy down to and through the small merchants
and professional men, I now discovered that there was
a corresponding and reversed disease&mdash;the abandoned
husband.</p>

<p>The husband and father, working hard and presently
accumulating enough for ease in his particular station
of life, suddenly finds himself supporting, with perhaps
all the money he can scrape together, a distant and
completely detached family. He mails his money regularly,
and with a fidelity that will appear grotesque,
noble, or pitiful according to the point of view. In return
he gets occasional letters from the loved ones&mdash;perfunctory
these letters somehow sound, or would sound
to the critical, though they are liberally sprinkled with
loving, even fawning phrases, such as &#8220;dear, sweet
papa&#8221; and &#8220;darling husband.&#8221; Where are &#8220;the loved
ones?&#8221; If the family home is in a small town or country,
they are in New York or some other city of America
usually. If the family home is in the city, they are
abroad. What are they doing? Sacrificing themselves!
Especially poor wife and mother. She would infinitely
prefer being at home with beloved husband. But she
must not be selfish. She must carry her part of their
common burden. While <i>he</i> toils to provide for the children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
<i>she</i> toils in the loneliness or unhappiness of New
York or Paris or Rome or Dresden or Genoa. And what
is she toiling at in those desert places? Why, at educating
the children!</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s music. Sometimes it&#8217;s painting.
Again it&#8217;s &#8220;finishing,&#8221; whatever that may mean, or
plain, vague &#8220;education.&#8221; There was a time when men
of any sort could be instantly abashed, silenced and
abased by the mere pronouncing of the word education.
That happy day for mental fakers is nearing its close.
Now, at the sound of the sacred word many a sensible,
practical man has the courage to put on a grin. I have
been credited with saying that a revival of the declining
child-bearing among American women might be looked
for, now that they have found the usefulness of children
as an excuse for escape from home and husband. I admit
having said this, but I meant it as a jest. However,
there is truth in the jest. I don&#8217;t especially blame the
women. Why should they stay at home when they have
no sympathy with the things that necessarily engross
the husband? Why stay at home when it bores them
even to see that the servants carry on the house decently?
Why stay at home when they simply show
there from day to day how little they know about
housekeeping? Why stay at home when there is an
amiable fool willing to mail them his money, while they
amuse themselves gadding about Europe or some big
city of America?</p>

<p>Abandoned wives at the one end of the social scale,
abandoned husbands at the other end. Please note that
in both cases the deep underlying cause is the same&mdash;money.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Too little money, and the husband flies; too
much money, and it is the wife who breaks up the family.</p>

<p>As soon as I discovered, by being elected to membership,
the existence of the universal order of abandoned
husbands I took the liveliest interest in it. I was eager
to learn whether there was another fool quite so foolish
as myself, also whether the other fools were aware of
their own folly. I found that most of them were rather
proud of their membership, indulged in a ludicrous cocking
of the comb and waggling of the wattles when they
spoke of &#8220;my family over on the other side for a few
years,&#8221; or of &#8220;my wife, poor woman, exiled in Paris to
cultivate my daughter&#8217;s voice,&#8221; or of &#8220;my invalid wife&mdash;she
has to live in the south of France. It&#8217;s a sad trial
to us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then&mdash;but this came much later&mdash;I discovered that
these credulous, money-mailing fools, including myself,
were not quite so imbecile, as a class, as they seemed to
be. I discovered that they were secretly, often unconsciously,
glad to be rid of their uncongenial families,
and regarded any money they mailed as money well
spent. They toiled cheerfully at distasteful tasks to
get the wherewithal to keep their loved ones far, far
away!</p>

<p>The absence of Edna and Margot was an enormous
relief to me. Edna was constantly annoying me to accompanying
her to places to which I did not care to go.
I like the theatre and I rather like some operas, but when
I go to either it is for the sake of the performance.
Going with Edna and her friends meant a tedious social
function. We arrived late; we did not hear the play or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the opera. As for the purely social functions, they were
intolerable. Perhaps I should not have been so unhappy
had I been the kind of man who likes to talk for the sake
of hearing his own voice. Women are attentive listeners
when the man who is talking is worth flattering. But
I talk only for purpose, and when I listen I wish it to
be to some purpose also. So, Edna, always urging me
to do something distasteful or giving me the sense that
she was about to ask me, or was irritated against me for
being &#8220;disobliging&#8221;&mdash;Edna made me uncomfortable, increasingly
uncomfortable as I grew more intelligent,
more critical, more discriminating. As for Margot, I
could not talk with her ten minutes without seeing protrude
from her sweet loveliness some vulgarity of snobbishness.
It irritated me to hear her speak to a servant.
I had to rebuke her privately several times for the tone
she used in addressing her governess or my secretary&mdash;this
when her mother and all her mother&#8217;s friends used
precisely the same repellent &#8220;gracious&#8221; tone in the same
circumstances. I saw that she, sometimes instinctively,
again deliberately tried to hide her real self from me,
that I was making a hypocrite of her. Any sort of
frankness or sympathy between her and me was impossible.</p>

<p>A few weeks after their departure I closed the house.
It came to me that I need endure its discomforts no
longer, that I could get rid of those smelly, dull-witted,
low-minded foreign animals, that I need not endure food
sent up from a kitchen as to which I had from time to
time disgusting proofs that it was not clean. I closed
the house and left the mice and roaches and other insects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to such short provender as would be provided by caretaker
and family. I took an apartment in a first-class
hotel.</p>

<p>When Armitage got clear of his wife he took the
adjoining apartment. And how comfortable and how
cheerful we were!</p>

<p>The women with their incompetence and indifference
have about destroyed the American home. To get good
service, to have capable people assisting you, you must
yourself be capable. The incapacity of the &#8220;ladies&#8221;
has driven good servants out of the business of domestic
service, has left in it only the worthless and unreliable
creatures who now take care of the homes. If you find
any part of the laboring class deteriorating, don&#8217;t blame
them. To do that is to get nowhere, is to be unjust
and shallow to boot. Instead, look at the employers of
that labor. Every time, you will find the fault is there,
just as an ill-mannered or a bad child means unfaithful
parents. The masses of mankind must have leadership,
guidance, example. My experience has been that they
respond when the dominating classes do their duty&mdash;that
is, pay proper wages, demand good service, <i>and
know what good service is</i>.</p>

<p>What a relief and a joy that hotel was! Armitage
and I had our own cook, and so could have the simple
dishes we liked. We attended to the marketing&mdash;and
both knew what sort of meat and vegetables and fruit to
buy, and were not long trifled with by our butcher, our
grocer, and our dairyman, spoiled though they were by
the ladies. And our apartments were clean&mdash;really
clean, and after the first few weeks our servants were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
contented, and abandoned the evil ways slip-shod
mistresses had got them into. Pushing my inquiries, I
found that not only our hotel, but every first-class hotel
in the fashionable district was filled with the remnants
of shattered homes&mdash;husbands who had compelled their
wives to give up the expensive and dirty attempts at
housekeeping; husbands who had abandoned their families
in country homes or in other cities and towns and
had, surreptitiously or boldly, returned to bachelor
bliss; husbands who had been abandoned by their families,
none of these last cases being more heart-breaking
than Armitage&#8217;s or my own. The story ran that he
was on the verge of melancholia because his beautiful
wife had cast him off. There was no more truth in this
than there would have been in a tale of my lonely grief.
Had it not been for Armitage, pointing out to me the
truth, I might have fancied myself a deserted unfortunate.
It would not have been an isolated instance of
a human being not knowing when he is well off.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I did not see my family again until the following
spring. Business compelled me to go abroad, and they
had come over to London for the season.</p>

<p>When I descended from the train at Euston, a little
confused by the strangeness, I saw my wife a few yards
down the platform. Beside her stood a tall, beautiful
young woman, whom I did not instantly recognize as my
daughter. Both were dressed with the perfection of
taste and of detail that has made the American woman
famous throughout the world. I like well-dressed
women&mdash;and well-dressed men, too. I should certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
have been convicted of poor taste had I not been dazzled
by those two charming examples of fashion and style.
They looked like two lovely sisters, the elder not more
than five or six years in advance of the younger. I was
a youthful-looking man, myself&mdash;except, perhaps, when
I was in the midst of affairs and took on the air of responsibility
that cannot appear in the face of youth.
But no one would have believed there were so few years
between Edna and me. Nor was she in the least made-up.
The youth was genuinely there.</p>

<p>That meeting must have impressed the by-standers,
who were observing the two women with admiring interest.
I felt a glow of enthusiasm at sight of these
elegant beauties. I was proud to be able to claim them.
As for them, they became radiant the instant they saw
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey!&#8221; cried Edna loudly, rushing toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa&mdash;dear old papa!&#8221; cried Margot, waving her
arms in a pretty gesture of impatient adoration while
her mother was detaining me from her embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;well!&#8221; cried I. &#8220;What a pair of girls!
My, but you&#8217;re tearing it off!&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed gayly, and hugged and kissed me all
over again. For a moment I felt that I had been missed&mdash;and
that I had missed them. A good-looking, shortish
and shy young man, dressed and groomed in the
attractive English upper-class way of exquisiteness with
no sacrifice of manliness, was now brought forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Crossley&mdash;my husband,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleased, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; murmured the young man, giving
me his hand with an awkwardness that was somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
not awkward&mdash;or, rather, that conveyed a subtle impression
of good breeding. &#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve got him&mdash;or
that he&#8217;s got you,&#8221; proceeded he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll toddle
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife gave him her hand carelessly. &#8220;Until dinner,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Margot shook hands with him, and nodded and
smiled. When he was gone I observed the carriage near
which we were standing&mdash;and I knew at once that it was
my wife&#8217;s carriage. It was a grand car of state, yet
quiet and simple. I often looked at it afterwards, trying
to puzzle out how it contrived to convey two exactly
opposite impressions. I could never solve the mystery.
On the lofty box sat the most perfect model of a coachman
I had seen up to that time. Beside the open door
in the shallow, loftily hung body of the carriage stood
an equally perfect footman. I was soon to get used to
that marvelous English ability at specializing men&mdash;a
system by which a man intended for a certain career is
arrested in every other kind of growth, except only that
which tends to make him more perfect for his purpose.
Observing an English coachman, or valet or butler or
what not, you say, &#8220;Here is a remarkably clever man.&#8221;
Yet you soon find out that he is practically imbecile in
every other respect but his specialty.</p>

<p>We entered the carriage, I sitting opposite the ladies&mdash;and
most uncomfortable I was; for the carriage was
designed to show off its occupants, and to look well in
it they had to know precisely how to sit, which I did not.
No one noticed me, however. There was too much
pleasure to be got out of observing Edna and Margot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
who were looking like duchesses out of a storybook. I
knew they were delightfully conscious of the sensation
they were making, yet they talked and laughed as if
they were alone in their own sitting room&mdash;a trick which
is part of that &#8220;education&#8221; of which you have heard
something, and will hear still more. The conversation
seemed easy. In fact, it was only animated. It was
a fair specimen of that whole mode of life. You have
seen the wonderful peaches that come to New York
from South Africa early in the winter&mdash;have delighted
in their exquisite perfection of color and form. But
have you ever tasted them? I would as lief eat sawdust;
I would rather eat it&mdash;for, of sawdust I should
expect nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;That young man is the Marquis of Crossley,&#8221; said
my wife.</p>

<p>I liked to hear her pronounce a title in private. It
gave you the sense of something that tasted fine&mdash;made
you envy her the sensation she was getting. &#8220;Who is
he?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Margot laughed na&iuml;vely&mdash;an entrancing display of
white teeth and rose-lined mouth. &#8220;Marquis of Crossley,
papa,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s all&mdash;and quite enough
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about the big men in England,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;He looked rather young to amount to very
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as old as you are,&#8221; said Edna, a flash of ill-humor
appearing and vanishing.</p>

<p>I was astonished. &#8220;I thought him a boy,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of the greatest nobles in England&mdash;one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of the greatest in Europe,&#8221; said Edna&mdash;and I saw Margot&#8217;s
eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seemed a nice fellow,&#8221; said I amiably. &#8220;How
you have grown, Margot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t she, though!&#8221; cried my wife. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you proud of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you both,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You make me
feel old and dingy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been working too hard, poor dear,&#8221; said
Edna tenderly. &#8220;If you only would stay over here and
learn the art of leisure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d be dismally bored,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>I had heard much about the art of loafing as practiced
by Europeans, and I had not been attracted by
what I had heard. It was inconceivable to me that intelligent
grown men could pass their time at things
about equal to marbles and tops. But I suppose I am
abnormal, as they allege. Many men seem to look on
mental effort of any kind as toilsome, and seize the first
opportunity to return to the mindless frolickings of the
beasts of the field. To me mental effort is a keen pleasure.
And I must add I can&#8217;t help thinking it is to
everybody who has real brains.</p>

<p>The conversation would have died in distressing
agony had it not been for the indomitable pluck of my
wife. She struggled desperately&mdash;perhaps may even
have deceived herself into thinking that she was glad to
see me and that the carriage was the scene of a happy
reunion. But I, who had a thorough training in quickly
sizing up situations, saw the truth&mdash;that I was a rank
outsider, to both wife and daughter; that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
strangers to me. I began to debate what was the shortest
time I could decently stop in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to be presented at Court next week,&#8221; said
Edna.</p>

<p>Margot&#8217;s eyes were again sparkling. It was the
sort of look the novelists put on the sweet young girl&#8217;s
face when she sees her lover coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;next week&mdash;next Thursday,&#8221; said Edna.
&#8220;And so another of the little duchess&#8217;s dreams is coming
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it exciting?&#8221; said I to Margot. Somehow reference
to the &#8220;little duchess&#8221; irritated me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather!&#8221; exclaimed Margot, fairly glowing with
ecstasy. &#8220;You put on the most wonderful dress, and
you drive in a long, long line of wonderful carriages,
with all the women in wonderful dresses. And you go
into the palace through lines and lines of gorgeous
liveries and uniforms&mdash;and you wait in a huge grand
room for an hour or so, frightened to death&mdash;and then
you walk into the next room and make the courtesy you
have been practicing for weeks&mdash;and you pass on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried I. &#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why you go home, half dead from the nervous
shock. Oh, it&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to me&mdash;for I was becoming somewhat
critical, as is the habit in moods of irritation&mdash;it
seemed to me that Margot&#8217;s elaborate and costly education
might have included the acquiring of a more
extensive vocabulary. That word wonderful was beginning
to get on my nerves. Still, this was hyper-criticism.
A lovely woman does not need a vocabulary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
or anything else but a lovely dress and plenty of money
to provide background. &#8220;Yes&mdash;it must be&mdash;wonderful,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working at it for weeks, mamma and
I,&#8221; continued she. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we shall do well. I can
hardly wait. Just fancy! I&#8217;m to meet the <i>king</i> and
the <i>queen</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that Edna was in the same ecstatic trance. I
leaned back and tried to distract myself with the novelty
of London houses and crowds. It may be you understand
the mingling of pity, contempt, anger, and
amusement that filled my breast. If you do not understand,
explanation would merely weary you. I was no
longer proud of my beautiful family; I wished to get
away from them, to forget them. Edna and Margot
chatted on and on about the king and queen, about the
various titled people they knew or hoped to know, about
the thrills of aristocratic society. I tried not to listen.
After a while I said, with I hope not unsuccessful attempt
at amiability:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I shan&#8217;t be here to witness your triumph.&#8221;</p>

<p>Across Edna&#8217;s face swept a flash of vivid&mdash;I had
almost said vicious&mdash;annoyance. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going
before the drawing-room at Buckingham Palace!&#8221; cried
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t!&#8221; protested Margot, tears of vexation
in her eyes. &#8220;Everyone will think it&#8217;s dreadfully
queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret about that, my dear,&#8221; replied I lightly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
&#8220;I know how it is over here. So long as you&#8217;ve got
the cash they&#8217;ll never ask a question. We Americans
mean money to them&mdash;and that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa!&#8221; cried Margot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put such ideas into the child&#8217;s head, Godfrey,&#8221;
said my wife, restraining herself in a most ladylike
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows,&#8221; said I. &#8220;So do you. Money is everything
with aristocracies everywhere. They must live
luxuriously without work. That can&#8217;t be done without
money&mdash;lots of money. So aristocrats seriously think
of nothing else, whatever they may talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a better opinion of them when you
know them,&#8221; said Edna, once more serene and sweetly
friendly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think badly of them,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I admire
their cleverness. But you mustn&#8217;t ask me to respect
them. They hardly expect it. They don&#8217;t respect
themselves. If they did, they&#8217;d not be stealing, but
working.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot listened with lowered eyes. I saw that she
was ashamed of and for me. Edna concealed her feelings
better. She forced an amiable smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know much about these things,&#8221; she said politely.
&#8220;But, Godfrey, you mustn&#8217;t desert us, at least not until
after the drawing-room. I&#8217;ve told our ambassador
you&#8217;re to be here, and he has gone to no end of trouble
to arrange for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howard?&#8221; said I. &#8220;That pup! I despise him.
He&#8217;s a rotten old snob. They tell me his toadyism turns
the stomach of even the English. He&#8217;s a disgrace to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
our country. But I suppose he&#8217;s little if any worse
than most of our ambassadors over here. They&#8217;ve all
bought their jobs to gratify their own and their wives&#8217;
taste for shoe polish.&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech so depressed the ladies that their last
remnant of vivacity fled, not to return. You are sympathizing
with them, gentle reader, and they are welcome
to your sympathy. We drove in silence the rest
of the way to the hotel in Piccadilly, where they were
installed in pompous luxury and had made equally luxurious
provision for me. When I was alone with my
valet I reasoned myself out of the grouchy mood into
which the evidences of my family&#8217;s fresh access of folly
had thrown me. To quarrel with them, to be irritated
against them, was about as unreasonable as attacking a
black man for not being white. I had long since realized,
as the result of much experience and reflection,
that character is no more to be changed than any other
inborn quality. My wife had been born an aristocrat,
and had brought into the world an aristocratic daughter.
She was to be blamed neither for the one thing
nor for the other. And it ill became my pretensions
to superior intellect to gird at her and at Margot. The
thing for me to do was to let them alone&mdash;keep away.</p>

<p>At dinner, which was served in our apartment, I
took a different tone with them, and they met me more
than half way. So cheered was my lovely daughter that
after dinner she perched on the arm of my chair and
ventured to bring up the dangerous subject. Said she:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to be mean to me and run away,
are you, papa?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>Looking at Edna, but addressing Margot, I replied:
&#8220;Your mother will tell you that it&#8217;s best. We three
never can agree in our ideas of things. I&#8217;m an irritation.
I spoil your pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no, indeed!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking
forward to your coming. I&#8217;ve been telling everybody
how handsome and superior you are. And I want
them to see for themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most pleasant to hear from such rare prettiness, and
most sincerely spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;So many of the American men in society over here
are common,&#8221; proceeded she, &#8220;and even those who
aren&#8217;t so very common somehow seem so. They are
down on their knees before titles, and they act&mdash;like
servants. Even Mr. Howard&mdash; He oughtn&#8217;t to show
his feelings so plainly. Of course we all feel impressed
and honored by being taken up by real titled people of
old families, but it&#8217;s such bad form to show, and it interferes
with getting on. When I&#8217;m talking to Lord Crossley
about that drawing-room, I act as if it were
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you are being well educated,&#8221; said I, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Mamma and I have worked. We&#8217;ve not
had an idle moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i> stay, papa&mdash;won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. But it was no longer the positive
gesture. My besetting sin, my good nature, had
possession of me. Remember, it was after dinner, and
my beautiful daughter was caressing my cheek and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
pleading in a voice whose modulations had been cultivated
by the best masters in Paris.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want people to think I was deceiving
them about my papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to be exhibited to a select few in the
next two or three days,&#8221; I conceded. &#8220;They will tell
the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that they had to be content. In the faint
hope of inducing me to change my mind, Edna&mdash;the
devoid of the sense of humor&mdash;took me to a tailor&#8217;s
and had me shown pictures and models of the court
costume I would wear. But I remained firm. A sense
of humor would have warned her that a person of my
sort would have an aversion to liveries of every kind,
to any costume that stamps a man as one of a class.
I am perhaps foolishly jealous of my own individuality.
But I cannot help it. A king in his robes, a general in
his uniform&mdash;except in battle where it&#8217;s as necessary
and useful as night shirt or pajamas in bed&mdash;any sort
of livery seems pitiful and contemptible to me. I will
wear the distinguishing dress of the human race and
the male sex, but further than that classification I
refuse to move. Also, what business had I, citizen of
a democracy whose chief idea is the barbarism and
silliness of aristocracy&mdash;what business had I going to
see a king and a queen? I should have felt that I was
aiding them in the triumph of dragging democracy at
their chariot wheels. No, I would not go to levees and
drawing-rooms. You may say I showed myself an absurd
extremist. Well, perhaps so. But, as it seems
to be necessary to go to one extreme or the other, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
prefer the extreme of exaggerated and vainglorious
self-respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;The king and queen are no doubt nice people,&#8221;
said I to Margot. &#8220;But if I meet them, it must be
on terms of equality&mdash;and for some purpose less inane
than exchanging a few set phrases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna and Margot seemed to feel that they had,
on the whole, a presentable specimen of male relative
to exhibit; for they made the most of the four days I
gave them. Through Hilda Armitage, now Lady
Blankenship, and much freshened up by the more congenial
atmosphere, they had got in with the set that is
the least easy of access to Americans&mdash;though, of
course, it is not actually difficult for any American
with plenty of money and a willingness to spend and
good guidance in how to spend. And I must admit
I enjoyed myself in those four days. The women
were, for the most part, rather slow, though I recall
two who had real intelligence, and I don&#8217;t think
there was a single one quite so devoid of knowledge of
important subjects as our boasted &#8220;bright&#8221; American
women. The men were distinctly attractive.
They had information, they had breadth&mdash;the thing
the upper-class men of America often lack. Also,
they were entirely free from that ill-at-easeness about
their own and their neighbor&#8217;s position in society
which makes the American upper classes tiresome and
ridiculous.</p>

<p>It amused me to observe the Americans in this environment.
Both our women and our men seemed uneasy,
small, pinched. You could distinguish the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
man instantly by his pinched, tight expression of
an upper servant out for a holiday. I could feel the
same thing in our women, but I doubt not their looks
and dress and vivacity concealed it from the Englishmen.
Anyhow, women are used to being nothing in
themselves, to taking rank and form from their surroundings.
While with us it seems to be true that the
women are wholly responsible for social position with
all its nonsense, the deeper truth is that they owe everything
to the possessions of their fathers or husbands.
Without that backing they would be nothing. Everything
must ultimately rest upon a substantiality. In
themselves, unsupported, the women&#8217;s swollen pretensions
would vanish into thin air.</p>

<p>Lord Crossley was to have dined with us my first
evening in London, but was prevented by suddenly
arising business in the country. Next day he came
to lunch, and I at once saw that he was after Margot
hammer and tongs. I discovered it not by the way he
treated her, but by his attitude toward her mother and
me. He seemed a thoroughly satisfactory young man
in every way, and I especially liked his frankness and
simplicity. Edna had devoted a large part of a long
sight-seeing tour with me to an account of his grandeur
in the British aristocracy. Having had experience
at that time of the American brand of aristocracy
only, I was ignorant of the European kinds that have
the aristocratic instinct in the most acute form&mdash;the
ingrowing form. I know now that our own sort, unpleasant
and unsightly though it is, cannot compare
in malignance, in littleness and meanness of soul with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the European sort. Just as the noisy blowhard is a
modest fellow and harmless, and on acquaintance lovable
in comparison with the silent, brooding egotist,
just so is the American aristocrat in comparison with
the European. An American aristocrat has been known
to forget himself and be human. I recall no instance
of that sort in an European born and bred to the notion
that his flesh and blood are of a subtler material
than the flesh and blood of most men. However, as I
was saying, at the time of my first visit to Europe I
knew nothing of these matters, and Lord Crossley
seemed to me a simple, ingenuous young man, most
attractively boyish for his years.</p>

<p>&#8220;That chap wants to marry Margot,&#8221; said I to
Edna when we were alone later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Several young men wish
to marry her. But she is in no hurry. She&#8217;s not nineteen
yet, and she would like a duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But she may not be able
to love a duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of a girl who wouldn&#8217;t love a duke
if she got the chance,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;There are only
five&mdash;English dukes, I mean&mdash;who are eligible. Margot
has met three of them&mdash;and one, the Duke of Brestwell,
has taken quite a fancy to her.&#8221; Carelessly, but
with nervous anxiety underneath, &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have
any objection?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;you are so&mdash;so peculiar in some ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone who pleases Margot will suit me,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were afraid you&#8217;d be prejudiced against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
titles. You&#8217;ve been with that eccentric Mr. Armitage
so much&mdash;and you always have been against the sort
of things Margot and I like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no objection to titles,&#8221; said I. &#8220;In fact, I
think Margot will be happier if she marries a title.
You&#8217;ve educated her so well that she&#8217;ll never see the
man or think of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How little you know her!&#8221; cried Edna, pathetically.
&#8220;And how unjust to me your prejudices make
you. I&#8217;ve brought her up to be all refinement&mdash;all
sentiment&mdash;all heart. She looks only at the highest
and best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the duke,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly at the duke,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Her tastes
are for the life where a woman can show her beauty of
soul to the best advantage and can do the most good.
There is no career for a woman in America. But over
here a woman married into the aristocracy has a real
career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At what?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a recognized social leader. As a leader in
charities and all sorts of good movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see,&#8221; said I&mdash;and there I stopped, for I had
learned not to argue with my wife&mdash;or with anyone
else, male or female&mdash;when the subject is sheer twaddle.
&#8220;Yes, I think Margot would do well to marry over
here and to have a dazzling career. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d
never get tired of this&mdash;pardon me&mdash;treadmill. I observe
that it&#8217;s better organized than the imitation one
we have over in &#8216;the States.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say!&#8221; cried Edna. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
how cheap and common the best you have in New York
is beside the social life here. I&#8217;ve been here only a
year, but already there have been the greatest changes
in me. Don&#8217;t you notice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And I can honestly say you have
changed for the better. You&#8217;ve learned to cover
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked inquiringly at me, but I did not care
to explain what the &#8220;it&#8221; was that she had learned to
cover. A slight flush appeared in her cheeks, and I
knew intuitively that she thought I was alluding to her
humble origin. I did not disabuse her mind of this
impression. She would have been angry had I explained
that I meant her social ambitions which I
thought vulgar and she thought refined. Both she and
Margot, except in occasional unguarded moments in
privacy, had indeed vastly improved in manners. They
had learned the trick of the aristocrats they associated
with&mdash;the trick of affecting simplicity and equality and
quietly confident ease. There was a notable difference,
and altogether in their favor, between their manners
and the manners of the former Mrs. Armitage and
other American women. Whatever might justly be
said in the way of criticism of my wife, it assuredly
could not be said that she was lacking in agility at
&#8220;catching on.&#8221; Armitage once said to me, &#8220;Your
wife is a marvelous woman. I never saw or heard of
her making a break.&#8221; This tribute can be appreciated
only when you recall whence she sprung&mdash;and how
much of her origin remained with her&mdash;necessarily&mdash;through
all her climbings and soarings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;You prefer it over here?&#8221; said I&mdash;we were still
driving.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it weren&#8217;t for you, I&#8217;d never go back,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t bother about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do,&#8221; replied she sweetly. And her hand
covertly stole into mine for a moment. &#8220;Sometimes
I get so homesick, Godfrey, that&#8217;s it all I can do to
fight off the impulse to take the first steamer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to look as a man should on hearing such
pleasant and praiseworthy sentiments from the wife of
his bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve acted cold and&mdash;and reserved with me,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;I wanted to come to you last night. But
I hadn&#8217;t the courage. You are such a mixture of tenderness
and&mdash;and aloofness. You have the power to make
even me feel like a stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t mean to be that way,&#8221; said I,
thoroughly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot was speaking of it,&#8221; proceeded Edna.
&#8220;She said&mdash;poor affectionate child&mdash;that she hardly
dared put her arms round you and kiss you. You
oughtn&#8217;t to repulse the child that way, Godfrey. She
has a tender, loving heart. And she adores you. She
and I talk of you a long time every day. I&#8217;d insist
on it as a matter of duty&mdash;for I&#8217;d not let your child
forget you. But I don&#8217;t need to insist. She refers
everything to you, and whenever she&#8217;s unusually happy,
she always says: &#8216;If papa could only be enjoying this
with us!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that she had worked herself up into a state
of excitement. My good sense told me that there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
no genuineness in either her affection or Margot&#8217;s. But
I had no doubt they both thought themselves genuine.
And that was quite enough to give me, the easy-going
American slob of a husband and father, an acute attack
of guilty conscience. The upshot was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But you who have an impressionable heart and a
keen sense of your own shortcomings can guess what
it was. Edna and I resumed the relations of affectionate
husband and wife for the rest of my&mdash;brief&mdash;stop
in London. I remained several days longer than
I had intended&mdash;stayed on because I did not wish to
hurt her feelings. And I bought her and Margot all
sorts of jewelry and gew-gaws, largely increased her
personal fortune, did not utter a word that would ruffle
either of them. And I left them convinced that I was
going only because business not to be neglected compelled.</p>

<p>They say that the hypocrite wife is a common occurrence.
I wonder if the hypocrite husband is rare.
I wonder if there are not more instances than this
one of the husband and the wife playing a cross game
of hypocrisy, with each fancying the other deceived?</p>

<p>So busy was I with my own laborings to deceive
my wife as to the true state of my feelings toward her
that not until I was halfway across the Atlantic did I
happen to think the obvious thought. You, gentle
reader, have not thought it. But perhaps some more
intelligent species of reader has. In mid-Atlantic, I
suddenly thought: &#8220;Why she&mdash;she and Margot&mdash;were
playing a game&mdash;the same game. For what purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not many months before I found out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> summer Armitage was spending the week
ends out on Long Island at the country place of his
sister, Mrs. Kirkwood. He kept his yacht in the tiny
harbor there and made short cruises in the Sound
and up the New England coast. Naturally I often
went with him. Those parties usually amused me. He
knew a dozen interesting people&mdash;working people&mdash;such
as Boris Raphael, the painter, and his wife, the
architect, the Horace Armstrongs who had been divorced
and remarried, a novelist named Beechman who
wrote about the woods and lived in the wilderness in
the Southwest most of the year, Susan Lenox the actress&mdash;several
others of the same kind. Then there was
his sister&mdash;Mary Kirkwood.</p>

<p>For a reason which will presently appear I have
not before spoken of Mrs. Kirkwood, though I had
known her longer than I had known Armitage. Her
husband had been treasurer of the road when I was
an under Vice President. He speculated in the road&#8217;s
funds and it so happened that, when he was about to
be caught, I was the only man who could save him from
exposure. Instead of asking me directly, he sent his
wife to me. I can see her now as she was that day&mdash;pale,
haggard, but with that perfect composure which
deceives the average human being into thinking, &#8220;Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
is a person without nerves.&#8221; She told me the whole
story in the manner of one relating a matter in which
he has a sympathetic but remote interest. She made
not the smallest attempt to work upon my feelings, to
move me to pity. &#8220;And,&#8221; she ended, &#8220;if you will help
him cover up the shortage, it will be made good and
he will resign. I shall see to it that he does not take
another position of trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he come to me, himself?&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Why did he send you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me&mdash;a steady gaze from a pair of
melancholy gray eyes. &#8220;I cannot answer that,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; stammered I; for I guessed
the answer to my question even as I was asking it. I
knew the man&mdash;an arrogant coward, with the vanity
to lure him into doing preposterous things and wilting
weakness the instant trouble began to gather. &#8220;You
wish me to save him?&#8221; I said, still confused and not
knowing how to meet the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am asking rather for myself,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;I
married him against my father&#8217;s wishes and warning.
I have not loved him since the second month of our
marriage. If he should be exposed, I think the disgrace
would kill me.&#8221; Her lip curled in self-scorn.
&#8220;A queer kind of pride, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said. &#8220;To be
able to live through the real shame, and to shrink only
from the false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said I, with a sudden complete change
of intention. &#8220;That is, if you promise me he will
resign and not try to get a similar position elsewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; said she, rising, to show that she was
taking not a moment more of my time than was unavoidable.
&#8220;And I thank you&#8221;&mdash;and that was all.</p>

<p>I kept my part of the agreement; she kept hers.
In about two years she divorced him because he was
flagrantly untrue to her. He married the woman and
supported her and himself on the allowance Mary Kirkwood
made him as soon as her father&#8217;s death let her into
her share of the property. When I saw her again&mdash;one
night at dinner at her brother&#8217;s house, before his
wife divorced him&mdash;we met as if we were entire strangers.
Neither of us made the remotest allusion to that
first meeting.</p>

<p>Going down to her house with Armitage often and
being with her on the yacht for days together, I became
fairly well acquainted with her, although she maintained
the reserve which she did not increase for a stranger
or drop even with her brother. You felt as if her
personality were a large and interesting house, with
room after room worth seeing, most attractive&mdash;but
that no one ever was admitted beyond the drawing-room,
not for a glimpse.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t picture her as of the somber sort of person.
A real tragedy can befall only a person with a highly
sensitive nature. Such persons always have sense of
proportion and sense of humor. They do not exaggerate
themselves; they see the amusing side of the
antics of the human animal. So they do not pull long
faces and swathe themselves in yards of cr&ecirc;pe and try
to create an impression of dark and gloomy sorrow.
They do not find woe a luxury; they know it in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
grim horror. They strive to get the joy out of life.
So, looking at Mary Kirkwood, you would never have
suspected a secret of sadness, a blighted life. As her
reserve did not come from self-consciousness&mdash;either the
self-consciousness of haughtiness or that of shyness and
greenness&mdash;you did not even suspect reserve until you
had known her long and had tried in vain to get
as well acquainted with her as you thought you were
at first. I imagine that in our talk in my office about
her husband I got further into the secret of her than
anyone else ever had.</p>

<p>One detail I shall put by itself, so important does
it seem to me. She had a keen sense of humor. It
was not merely passive, merely appreciation, as the
sense of humor is apt to be in women&mdash;where it exists
at all. It was also active; she said droll and even
witty things. When her sense of humor was aroused,
her eyes were bewitching.</p>

<p>What did she look like? The women all wish to
know this; for, being fond of the evanescent triumphs
over the male which beauty of face or form gives, and
as a rule having experience only of those petty victories,
they fancy that looks are the important factor,
the all-important factor. In fact, the real conquests
of women are not won by looks. Beauty, or, rather,
physical charm of some kind, is the lure that draws the
desired male within range. If after pausing a while
he finds nothing more, he is off again.</p>

<p>Perhaps, probably, my experience with Edna has
made me more indifferent to looks than the average man
who has never realized his longing to possess a physically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
beautiful woman. However that may be, Mary
Kirkwood certainly had no cause to complain that
Nature had not been generous to her in the matter of
looks. She was tall, she was slender. She had a delicate
oval face, a skin that was clear and smooth and dark
with the much prized olive tints in it. She had a beautiful
long neck, a great quantity of almost black hair.
Her nose suggested pride, her mouth mockery, her eyes
sincerity. She was the kind of woman who exercises
a powerful physical fascination over men, and at the
same time makes them afraid to show their feelings.
Women like that tantalize with visions of what they
could and would give the man they loved, but make
each man feel that it would be idle for him to hope.
In character she was very different from her cynical,
mocking brother&mdash;was, I imagine, more like her father.
Mentally the resemblance between the brother and sister
was strong&mdash;but she took pains to conceal how much
she knew, where he found his chief pleasure in &#8220;showing
off.&#8221; I feel I have fallen pitifully short of doing her
justice in this description. But who can put into words
such a subtlety as charm? She had it&mdash;for men. Women
did not like her&mdash;nor she them. I state this without
fear of prejudicing either women or men against her.
Why is it, by the way, that to say a man does not like
men and is not liked by them is to damn him utterly,
while to say that a woman neither likes nor is liked by
her own sex is rather to speak in her favor? You cry
indignantly, &#8220;Not true!&#8221; gentle reader. But&mdash;do <i>you</i>
know what is true and what not true? And, if you
did, would you confess it, even to yourself?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>You are proceeding to revenge yourself upon me.
You are saying, &#8220;<i>Now</i> we know <i>why</i> he was indifferent
to his beautiful wife and to his lovely daughter!&mdash;<i>Now</i>
we understand that fit of guilty conscience in
London!&#8221;</p>

<p>Do you know? Perhaps. I am not sure. I am
not conscious of any especial interest in Mary Kirkwood
until after I came back from London. I had seen
her but a few times. We had never talked so long as
five consecutive minutes, and then we had talked commonplaces.
Not the commonplaces of fashionable people,
but the commonplaces of intelligent people. There&#8217;s
an enormous difference.</p>

<p>The first time my memory records her with the vividness
of moving pictures is, of course, at that meeting in
my office. The next time is a few days after my return
from London. I had been surfeited both in London and
on the steamer with the inane amateurs at life, the shallow
elegant dabblers in it, interesting themselves only
in coaching, bridge, and similar pastimes worthy an
asylum for the feeble-minded. I went down to the Kirkwood
place with Armitage. As his sister was not in
the house we set out for a walk through the grounds to
find her. At the outer edge of the gardens a workman
told us that if we would follow a path through the
swampy woods we could not miss her.</p>

<p>The path was the roughest kind of a trail. Our
journey was beset with swarms of insects, most of them
mosquitoes in savage humor. It lay along the course
of a sluggish narrow stream that looked malarious and
undoubtedly was. &#8220;Landscape gardening is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Mary&#8217;s fads,&#8221; explained her brother. &#8220;She has been
planning to tackle this swamp for several years. Now
she is at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the depths of the morass we came upon her. She
was in man&#8217;s clothes&mdash;laboring man&#8217;s clothes. Her
face and neck were protected by veils, her hands by
gloves. She was toiling away with a gang of men at
clearing the ground where the drains were to center in
an artificial lake. Armitage called several times before
she heard. Then she dropped her ax and came
forward to meet us. There was certainly nothing of
what is usually regarded as feminine allure about her.
Yet never had I seen a woman more fascinating. There
undoubtedly was charm in her face and in her strong,
slender figure. But I believe the real charm of charms
for me was the spectacle of a woman usefully employed.
A woman actually doing something. A woman!</p>

<p>After the greeting she said: &#8220;The only way I can
get the men to work in this pesthole is by working with
them.&#8221; She smiled merrily. &#8220;One doesn&#8217;t look so well
as in a fresh tennis suit wielding a racket. But I can&#8217;t
bear doing things that have no results.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father insisted on bringing us up in the commonest
way and with the commonest tastes,&#8221; said Armitage,
&#8220;and Mary has remained even less the lady than
I am the gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the mosquitoes were tearing us to pieces Mrs.
Kirkwood ordered us back to the house. Before we were
out of sight she was leading on her gang and wielding
the ax again. At dinner she appeared in all the radiance
and grace of the beautiful woman with fondness for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
and taste in dress. She explained to me her plan&mdash;how
swamp and sluggish, rotting brook were to be transformed
into a wooded park with a swift, clear stream
and a succession of cascades. I may add, she carried
out the plan, and the results were even beyond what my
imagination pictured as she talked.</p>

<p>This first view of her life in the country set me to
observing her closely&mdash;perhaps more closely and from a
different standpoint than a man usually observes a
woman. In all she did I saw the same rare and fascinating
imagination&mdash;the only kind of imagination worth
while. Of all its stupidities and follies none so completely
convicts the human race of shallowness and bad
taste as its notions of what is romantic and idealistic.
The more elegant the human animal flatters itself it is,
the poorer are its ideals&mdash;that is, the further removed
from the practical and the useful. So, you rarely find
a woman with so much true poetry, true romance, true
imagination as to keep house well. But Mary Kirkwood
kept house as a truly great artist paints a picture, as
a truly great composer creates an opera. In all her
house there was not a trace of the crude, costly luxury
that rivals the squalor and bareness of poverty in repulsiveness
to people of sense and taste. But what
comfort! What splendid cooking, what perfection of
service. The chairs and sofas, the beds, the linen, the
hundred and one small but important devices for facilitating
the material side of life, and so putting mind and
spirit in the mood for their best&mdash; But I despair of
making you realize. I should have to catalogue, describe,
contrast through page after page. And when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
had finished, those who understand what the phrase art
of living means would have read only what they already
know, while those who do not understand that phrase
would be convulsed with the cackling laughter that is
the tribute of mush-brain to intellect.</p>

<p>Observing Mary Kirkwood I discovered a great
truth about the woman question: the crudest indictment
of the intellect of woman is the crude, archaic, futile,
and unimaginative way in which is carried on the part
of life that is woman&#8217;s peculiar work&mdash;or, rather, is
messed, muddled, slopped, and neglected. No doubt this
is not their fault. But it soon will be if they don&#8217;t bestir
themselves. Already there are American men not
a few who apologize for having married as a folly of their
green and silly youth.</p>

<p>So, gentle reader, though my enthusiasm tempts me
to describe Mary Kirkwood&#8217;s housekeeping in detail, I
shall spare you. You would not read. You would not
understand if you did.</p>

<p>The first time she and I approached the confidential
was on an August evening when we were alone on the
upper deck of the yacht. The others were in the cabin
playing bridge. We had been sitting there perhaps an
hour when she rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you wished to be alone,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your way of answering me. You&#8217;ve been almost
curt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I can&#8217;t promise to talk if you stay.
But I hate to be left alone with my thoughts.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said she. And she seated herself
beside the rail, and with my assistance lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>There was a moon somewhere above the awning which
gave us a roof. By the dim, uncertain light I could
make out her features. It seemed to me she was staying
as much on her own account as on mine&mdash;because she,
too, wished not to be alone with her thoughts. I had
not in a long time seen her in a frankly serious mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much better off a man is than a woman,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;A man has his career to think about, while a woman
usually has only herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only herself,&#8221; echoed she absently. &#8220;And if one
is able to think, oneself is an unsatisfactory subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Extremely,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Faults, follies, failures.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time I watched the faintly glowing end of her
cigarette and the slim fingers that held it gracefully.
Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe in a future life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone feel <i>sure</i> of any life but this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then this is one&#8217;s only chance to get what one
wants&mdash;what&#8217;s worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> worth while?&#8221; I inquired, feeling the
charm of her quiet, sweet voice issuing upon the magical
stillness. &#8220;What <i>is</i> worth while?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed softly. &#8220;What one wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do <i>you</i> want?&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her white scarf closer about her bare shoulders,
smiled queerly out over the lazily rippling waters.
&#8220;Love and children,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a normal woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>That amused me. &#8220;Normal? Why, you&#8217;re unique&mdash;eccentric.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Most women want money&mdash;and yet more
money&mdash;and yet more money&mdash;for more and more and
always more show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must want the same thing,&#8221; retorted she.
&#8220;You&#8217;re too sensible not to know you can&#8217;t possibly do
any good to others with money. So you must want it
for your own selfish purposes. It&#8217;s every bit as much
for show when you have it tucked away in large masses
for people to gape at as if you were throwing it round
as the women do.... If anything, your passion is
cruder than theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I make money,&#8221; said I, &#8220;for the same reasons
that a hen lays eggs or a cow gives milk&mdash;because
I can&#8217;t help it; because I can&#8217;t do anything else and
must do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever try to do anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I admitted. Then I added, &#8220;I never had the
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; she said reflectively. &#8220;A hen can&#8217;t give
milk and a cow can&#8217;t lay eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For some time,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to
find something else to do. Something interesting. No,
not exactly that either. I must find some way of reviving
my interest in life. The things I am doing would
be interesting enough if I could be interested in anything
at all. But I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;m in the same state,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve about decided what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said I encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry again,&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>I laughed outright. &#8220;That&#8217;s very unoriginal,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
I. &#8220;It puts you in with the rest of the women. Marrying
is all <i>they</i> can think of doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t quite understand,&#8221; said she. &#8220;<i>I</i>
want children. I am thinking of selecting some trustworthy
man with good physical and mental qualities.
I have had experience. I ought to be able to judge&mdash;and
not being in love with him I shall not be so likely
to make a mistake. I shall marry, and the children will
give me love and occupation. You may laugh, but I tell
you the only occupation worthy of a man or a woman is
bringing up children. All the rest&mdash;for men as well as
for women&mdash;is&mdash;is like a hen laying eggs to rot in the
weeds.... Bringing up children to develop us, to
give us a chance to make them an improvement on ourselves.
That&#8217;s the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the full meaning of what she had said unfolded
I was filled with astonishment. How clear and simple&mdash;how
true. Why had I not seen this long ago&mdash;why had
it been necessary to have it pointed out by another?
&#8220;I believe&mdash;yes, I&#8217;m sure&mdash;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been groping
for,&#8221; I said to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d understand,&#8221; said she, and most
flattering was her tone of pleasure at my obvious admiration.</p>

<p>Thus our friendship was born.</p>

<p>I could not but envy her freedom to seek to satisfy
the longing I thus discovered in my own heart. So
strongly did the mood for confidence possess me that
only my long and hard training in self-restraint held
me from the disloyalty of speaking my thoughts. I
said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s dismal to grow old with no ties in the oncoming
generation. The sense of the utter futility of life
would weigh more and more heavily. I&#8217;m surprised that
you&#8217;ve realized it so young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman realizes it earlier than a man,&#8221; she reminded
me. &#8220;For a woman has no career to interfere
and prevent her seeing the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>A woman! Rather, a rare occasional Mary Kirkwood.
Most women never looked beyond the gratification
of the crudest, easiest vanities and appetites. &#8220;Yes,
you are right,&#8221; I continued. &#8220;You ought to marry&mdash;as
soon as you can. The man isn&#8217;t important, except in
the ways you spoke of. So far as man and woman love
is concerned, that quickly passes&mdash;where it ever exists
at all. But the bond of father, mother, and children is
enduring&mdash;at least, I&#8217;m sure <i>you</i> would make it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat lost in thought for some time&mdash;I reflecting
moodily upon my own baffled and now seemingly hopeless
longing, she probably busy with the ideas suggested
in her next speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;The main trouble is money,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Except
for that my husband would have been all right. When
we first met he did not know my family had wealth. He
thought I belonged to another and poor branch. And I
think he cared for me, and would have been the man I
sought but for the money. It roused a dormant side of
his nature, and everything went to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, marry a rich man,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a single rich
man&mdash;except <i>possibly</i> my brother&mdash;who isn&#8217;t obsessed
about money. The rich have a craving to be richer that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
worse than the desire of the poor to be rich.... I don&#8217;t
know what to do. I couldn&#8217;t bring up children in the
atmosphere of wealth and caste and show&mdash;the sort of
atmosphere a man or woman crazy about money insists
on creating. My father was right. He was a really
wise man. I owe to him every good instinct and good
idea I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must have seen some man who promised
well. I think you can trust to your judgment. You
mustn&#8217;t defeat your one chance for happiness by overcaution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she was silent for several minutes. Then she
said, with a queer laugh and an embarrassed movement:
&#8220;I have seen such a man&mdash;lately. I like him. I think
I could like him more than a little. I&#8217;ve an idea he might
care for me if I&#8217;d let him. But&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that she longed to confide, but wished to be
questioned. &#8220;Here on the yacht?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beechman?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed shyly yet with amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was an easy guess,&#8221; said I. &#8220;He&#8217;s the only
man of us free to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very man I&#8217;d say,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;He&#8217;s good to
look at&mdash;clever, healthy, and honest. He isn&#8217;t money-mad.
He could make quite a splurge with what he
has, yet he doesn&#8217;t. He is a serious man&mdash;does not let
them tempt him into fashionable society or any other
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the objections?&#8221; said she. &#8220;My father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
trained us to look for the rotten spots, as he called them.
He said one ought to hunt them out and examine them
carefully. Then if, in spite of them, the thing still
looked good, why there was a chance of its being worth
taking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s precisely my way of proceeding in business,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity it isn&#8217;t used in every part of
life&mdash;from marketing up to choosing a friend or a husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what are the &#8216;rotten spots&#8217; in Mr. Beechman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t looked for them,&#8221; said I. &#8220;No doubt
they&#8217;re there, but as they&#8217;re not obvious they may be
unimportant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of <i>any</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was laughing, and so was I. Poor Beechman,
down in the cabin absorbed in bridge, how amazed he&#8217;d
have been if he could have heard! In my mind&#8217;s eye I
was looking him over&mdash;a tall, fair man with good smooth-shaven
features.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting bald rather rapidly for a man of
thirty or thereabouts,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like baldness,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But I can endure
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is distinctly vain of his looks and his strength.
But he has cause to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All men are physically vain,&#8221; said she. &#8220;And they
can&#8217;t help it, because it is the hereditary quality of the
male from fishes and reptiles up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s inclined to be opinionated, and his point of
view is narrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;I think I might hope to educate him out of that,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;I can be tactful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not a serious objection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any other spots?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a certain&mdash;a certain&mdash;lack of vigor. It&#8217;s
a thing I&#8217;ve observed in all professional men, except
those of the first rank, those who are really men of
action.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;I was waiting for that,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the thing that has made me hesitate.&#8221; She laughed
outright. &#8220;What a conceited speech! But I&#8217;m exposing
myself fully to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am picking him to pieces as if I thought myself
perfection. As a matter of fact, I know he&#8217;d fly from
me if he saw me as I am.&#8221; She reflected, laughed
quietly. &#8220;But he never would know me as I am. An
unconventional woman&mdash;if she&#8217;s sensible&mdash;only shows
enough of her variation from the pattern to make herself
interesting&mdash;never enough to be alarming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are unconventional?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t suspect it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. You smoke cigarettes&mdash;but that has ceased
to be unconventional.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather thought you had a favorable opinion of
my intelligence,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have,&#8221; said I. &#8220;To be perfectly frank,
you seemed to me to have as good a mind as your
brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is flattering,&#8221; said she, immensely pleased,
and with reason. &#8220;Well, if you thought so favorably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of my intelligence, how could you believe me conventional?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said I. &#8220;No one who thinks can be conventional.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conventionality,&#8221; said she, &#8220;was invented to save
some people the trouble of thinking and to prevent
others from being outrageous through trying to think
when they&#8217;ve nothing to think with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is worth remembering and repeating,&#8221;
laughed I. &#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m deeply grateful for conventionality.
You see, I came up from the bottom, and
I find it satisfactory to be able to refer to the rules in
all the things I knew nothing about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother says the most remarkable thing about
you&mdash;and your wife&mdash; Do you mind my telling you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says most people who come up are alternately
hopeless barbarians and hopelessly conventional, but
that you took the right course. You learned to be
conventional&mdash;learned the rules&mdash;before you ventured
to try to make personal variations in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m slow to risk variations,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Most of
the efforts in that direction are&mdash;eccentric. And I detest
eccentricity as much as I like originality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Beechman were only a little less conventional!&#8221;
sighed she. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;d be rather&mdash;&#8221;
She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiresome?&#8221; I ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiresome,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;But&mdash;there would be
the children. Do you think he&#8217;d try to interfere with
me there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never know that until you&#8217;ve married him,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity he has an occupation that would keep
him round the house most of the time,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a trial to a woman. She&#8217;s always being interrupted
when she wishes to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t expect too much,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I think
the children will be <i>your</i> children.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not reply in words. But a sudden strengthening
of her expression made me feel that I was getting
a glimpse of her father.</p>

<p>We talked no more of Beechman or of any personalities
related to this story. When the bridge party
broke up and a supper was served on deck, she and
Beechman sat together. And I gathered from the
sounds coming from their direction that he was making
progress. My spirits gradually oozed away and I sat
glumly pretending to listen while Mrs. Raphael talked
to me. Usually she interested me because she talked
what she knew and knew things worth while. But that
night I heard scarcely a word she said. When the
party, one by one, began to go below, Mrs. Kirkwood
joined me and found an opportunity to say, aside:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you talk with Mr. Beechman&mdash;and tell
me your honest opinion? You know I can&#8217;t afford to
make another mistake. And I&#8217;m in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood silent, smoking and staring out toward the
dim Connecticut shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be unfair to him,&#8221; she urged.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not especially his friend. I can&#8217;t ask anyone
else, and I believe in your judgment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;If I advised you, I&#8217;d be taking a heavy responsibility,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not that kind&mdash;you know I&#8217;m not,&#8221; replied
she. &#8220;I don&#8217;t ask advice, to have some one to blame if
things go wrong. Of course, if there&#8217;s a reason why
you can&#8217;t very well help me&mdash; Maybe you already
know something against him?&mdash;something you&#8217;ve no
right to tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said I, emphatically. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t
believe there is anything against him.&#8221; Then, on an
impulse of fairness and to wipe out the suspicion of
Beechman I had unwittingly created, I said: &#8220;Really,
there&#8217;s no reason why I shouldn&#8217;t size him up and give
you my opinion. I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thanked me with a fine lighting up of the eyes.
And the warm friendly pressure of her hand lingered
after she had long been below and was no doubt asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was my reason for hesitating? You have
guessed it, but you think I do not intend to admit.
You are deceived there. I admit frankly. I felt unable
to advise her because I found that I was in love
with her, myself. Yes, I was in love, and for the first
time in my life. The latest time of falling in love is
always the first. As we become older and more experienced,
better acquainted with the world, with ourselves,
with what we want and do not want&mdash;in a word, as we
<i>grow</i>, the meaning of love grows. And each time we
love, we see, as we look back over the previous times,
that what we thought was love was in fact simply educational.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>So, when I say I had never loved until I loved Mary
Kirkwood, I am speaking a truth which is worth thinking
about. I had reached the age, the stage of physical
and mental development, at which a man&#8217;s capacities
are at their largest&mdash;at which I could give love and
could appreciate love that was given to me. And I, who
could not ask or hope love from her, gave her all the love
I had to give. Gave because I could not help giving.
Who, seeing the best, can help wanting it?</p>

<p>But for my promise to her I should have left the
yacht early the following morning. As it was I stayed
on, with my mind made up to keep my word. Did I
stay because of my promise? Did I stay because I
loved her? I do not know. Who can fathom the real
motive in such a situation as that? I can only say that
I sought Beechman&#8217;s society and did my best to take
his measure. It had been so long my habit to judge
men without regard to my personal feeling about them
that, perhaps in spite of myself, I saw this man as he
was, not as I should have liked him to be. I found that
I had underestimated him. I had been prejudiced by
his taking himself too seriously&mdash;a form of vanity which
I happen particularly to detest. Also his sense of humor
was different from mine&mdash;a fact that had misled
me into thinking he had no sense of humor. I had
thought&mdash;shall I say hoped?&mdash;that I would find him
a man she could respect but could not love. I was
forced to abandon this idea. So far as a man can judge
another for a woman, he could succeed with almost any
heart-free woman. I wondered that Mary Kirkwood
should be uncertain about him. I might have drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
comfort from her having done so, had I not known how
she dreaded making a second mistake.</p>

<p>That day and the next, when I was not with him,
she was. I shan&#8217;t attempt to tell my emotions. That
sort of thing seems absurd to all the world but the one
who is suffering. Besides, the fact that I was a married
man would alienate the sympathies of all respectable
readers. Not that I am yearning for sympathy.
Those who have read thus far may have possibly gathered
that I am not one of those who live on sympathy
and wither and die without it. The only sympathy
human beings seem able to give one another, I have discovered,
is a species of self-complacent pity; and while
it may not be exactly a stone, it is certainly a most inferior
quality of bread.</p>

<p>The third morning I sought her out. She made
a picture of strong, slim young womanhood to cause
the heart&mdash;at least, my heart&mdash;to ache, as she leaned
against the rail in her blue-trimmed white linen dress
showing her lovely throat. Said I, avoiding her eyes:
&#8220;I&#8217;m off for the shore, and I wish to report before
leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashore!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why, you were to have
gone on to Bar Harbor and back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business&mdash;always business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed,&#8221; said she, and I saw with a furtive
glance that her face had quite lost its brightness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that, at least,&#8221; said I with a successful
enough attempt at lightness; for, as I have never been
the sort of man in whom women expect to find sentimentalism,
signs of embarrassment or other agitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
would be attributed to any other source before the
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost interest in the trip,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>I forced a smile. &#8220;Beechman isn&#8217;t going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s different,&#8221; said she, with a certain frank
impatience. &#8220;You&#8217;re the one person I can really talk
to.... Can&#8217;t you stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not let my face betray me. I waited before
speaking until I was sure of my voice. &#8220;Impossible,&#8221;
I said, perhaps rather curtly&mdash;for, mind you, I wished
to deal honestly with her, and was not trying to hint my
love while pretending to hide it. I know there is a notion
that love cannot be controlled. But the kind of love
that can&#8217;t be controlled is a selfish, greedy appetite and
not love at all. When the man doesn&#8217;t control his love
the woman may be sure he is thinking of himself only,
of her merely as a possible means of pleasure&mdash;is thinking
of her as the hungry hunter thinks of the fine fat
rabbit. Said I:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for my report on Beechman.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she would not let me escape. &#8220;Why are you
short with me?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Have I offended you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been everything
that&#8217;s kind and friendly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very idea of losing your friendship frightens
me,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a feeling for you&mdash;a feeling
of&mdash;of intimacy&#8221;&mdash;she flushed rosily&mdash;&#8220;that I have
for no one else in the world. Oh, I don&#8217;t expect you to
return it. No doubt I seem insignificant to you. Almost
anyone would want your friendship. You are
sure you aren&#8217;t leaving because you are bored?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;Absolutely sure. If I could explain my reason for
going you would see that I must. But I can&#8217;t explain.
So you&#8217;ll be glad to hear that I find Beechman even
more of a man than I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me apologetically. &#8220;You&#8217;ll think me
foolish, but since I&#8217;ve begun to try to like him better
I&#8217;ve been&mdash;almost&mdash;not liking him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am sure I beamed with delight. For, there are
limits&mdash;very narrow ones&mdash;to unselfishness in the most
considerate love. And I am not able to pose as more
than feebly unselfish. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t fair to him,&#8221; I said,
with more enthusiasm in my words than in my tone.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been judging him as carefully as I know how, and
I must in honesty say he is a rare man. You&#8217;ll not find
many like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me he&#8217;s worthy,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;or I shall
loathe him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he cares for you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he tell you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he would have if I had encouraged him....
I liked the way he spoke of you, and&#8221;&mdash;I hesitated,
could not hold back the words&mdash;&#8220;and I am not
easy to please there.&#8221; Those words were certainly far
from confession, were the mildest form of indiscretion.
Still, so determined was I to be square, and so guilty
did I feel, that they sounded like a contemptible attempt
stealthily to make love to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said gently. And her suddenly
swimming eyes and tender voice reminded me how alone
she was and how bitter her experience had been and
how she deserved happiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>I felt ashamed of myself. &#8220;I hope you will be
happy,&#8221; I said, perhaps rather huskily. &#8220;Anyone who
tried to prevent it would deserve to be killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me with such a steady, penetrating
gaze that I feared I had betrayed myself. In fact, I
knew I had. I glanced at my watch, put out my hand.
&#8220;I hate to go,&#8221; I said, in the tone of one man to another.
&#8220;But I must.&#8221; And as we shook hands, I repeated,
&#8220;I know you will be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed nervously; she, too, had become ill at
ease. &#8220;You make me feel engaged,&#8221; she said with an
attempt at mockery.</p>

<p>As the launch touched the shore I looked back. She
was leaning on the rail, Beechman beside her. He was
talking, but I felt sure she was not listening. As I
looked she waved her hand. I lifted my hat and hurried
away. And I learned the meaning of that word desolation.</p>

<p>Do not think, because I have not raved, talked of
the moon and stars, poetized about my soul states,
that therefore I did not love her. The banquet of
life spread so richly for me seemed a ghastly mockery.
What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world
and lose his own soul? I had lost my soul. I had
discovered how I might have been happy, and at the
same time I had discovered that it could never be&mdash;never.
And always before me she stood in her radiant
youth&mdash;intelligent, so capable, splendidly sincere&mdash;the
woman I loved, the woman I felt I could have made
love me.</p>

<p>There was my temptation&mdash;the feeling, the conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that I could win her love. She had confessed to a
friendship for me different from any she had for anyone
else in the world. If I were willing to take advantage
of her trust, of her liking, of her longing for love
and of my knowledge of it&mdash;if I were to let her see
how utterly I loved her&mdash;I could surely win her. There
were times when I said to myself: &#8220;You&mdash;even as you
are&mdash;can make her happier than anyone else could. She
would prefer what you can give her to what she will get
from Beechman. Your love gives you the right to
make her happy. You are letting foolish conventional
notions blind you to what is really right. If you had
acted in business in that fashion, you would not have
got far. Yet in the supreme crisis of your life you let
yourself be frightened off by a bogy of conventional
morality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps I was giving myself sound advice there. I
do not know. I only know that I put the temptation
behind me and went to work. The sentimental readers
will not forgive me. So be it. I am a plain man, rather
old-fashioned&mdash;prim, I believe it is called&mdash;in my ideas,
not at all the ladies&#8217; man. And I did not want to harm
her. I loved her.</p>

<p>I went to work. The sort of people who are ever
on the lookout for some excuse for going to pieces,
and the world is well sprinkled with them, eagerly
seize on disappointment in love as precisely what they
were seeking. At the risk of being thought cold and
hard, I will say that it is extremely fortunate for Joan
that she escaped the Darby who goes smash for disappointed
love of her. If Joan had yielded to him, Darby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
would simply have been put to the trouble of finding
another pretext for throwing up his job and taking to
drink. I confess it did not occur to me to give up
and fall to boozing and brooding. I should not have
dared do that; for, you see, I was really in love&mdash;not
with myself, but with Mary Kirkwood. I went to work.
I filled my days and my evenings with business engagements
that compelled both my time and my thought.
I took on an extra secretary. I started to build a
railway. I laid out an addition to the manufacturing
city I had founded. I organized a farm for teaching
city slum boys to be farmers. I engaged in several
entirely new mining and manufacturing enterprises.
The result was that when I went to bed, I slept; and
when they awakened me in the morning my brain was at
work before my head was well off the pillow. And still&mdash; You
can distract your mind from the aching tooth, but
it aches on.</p>

<p>All this time I was receiving weekly letters from
Edna and Margot&mdash;long and loving letters. I read
them, and you may possibly imagine I was filled with
shame and remorse. Not at all. My wife and my
daughter had rather exaggerated my vanity. Only
vanity could gull a husband and father in my position
into fancying himself the object of such luxuriant
affection as those letters professed. If you have lies
to tell, take my advice and don&#8217;t <i>write</i> them. I can&#8217;t
explain the mystery, but a lie which, spoken and heard,
passes out and passes in as smoothly as a greased shuttle
in its greased groove, becomes a glaring falsehood
when set down in black and white. The only effect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
those letters upon me was to make my sick heart the
sadder with the realization of what I had missed in
losing Mary Kirkwood.</p>

<p>And I kept wondering what it was that Edna and
Margot were slathering me for.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In September I got the key to the mystery. The
necessity of floating some bonds took me abroad again.
I found my family ensconced in beautiful luxury in an
apartment in Paris. You drove out the Champs Elys&eacute;es.
Not far from the President&#8217;s palace you drove in
at great doors&mdash;not gates, but doors&mdash;in a plain, unpretentious-looking
house wall. You were in a superb
garden of whose existence you had no hint from the
street. Magnificent bronze inner doors&mdash;powdered and
velveted lackeys&mdash;a majestic stairway leading to lofty
and gorgeous corridors and salons. Really my wife,
with the aid of those clever European professors of the
aristocratic art, had educated herself amazingly. On
every side there were evidences of her good taste in
furniture, in tapestries, in wall coverings, in pictures.
It was not the taste of a home maker, but it was
unquestionably good taste. It was not the sort of
taste I liked, but not to admire it would have been
to lack the sense of harmony in line and color. And
let me add in justice to her, it was her own taste.
There is no mistaking the difference between the
luxury that is merely bought and the luxury that is
created.</p>

<p>I submitted with what grace I could muster to the
exuberant hypocrisies of that greeting. But I got to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
business with all speed. &#8220;In the note I found in London
you said you had a surprise for me,&#8221; I said to
Edna. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How impatient you are,&#8221; laughed she. &#8220;Just like
a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether because the fashions of the day happened
to be peculiarly becoming or because she had actually
improved, she now had the loveliness more exquisite
than I had ever seen in woman. No doubt her piquant
face had charm for most people; for me it had none
whatever. I knew too well what lay beneath&mdash;or,
rather, what was not there, for like most human beings
her defects of character were not so much the presence
of the vices as the lack of the virtues.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for that surprise several months,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Your letters and Margot&#8217;s showed that some
shock was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shock? No, indeed!&#8221; And she and Margot
laughed gayly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t altogether a surprise,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at Margot. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; I said. &#8220;Margot is
engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot ran across the room and kissed me. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m so happy, papa!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the duke?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She made a wry face. &#8220;He was horrid!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t <i>endure</i> him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you had to fall back on the marquis?&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of the women liked this way of putting the
matter. It suggested that I knew the painful truth of
the failure of the ducal campaign. But they were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
to be put out of humor. &#8220;You liked him yourself,
papa,&#8221; said Margot.</p>

<p>I was abstractedly thinking how I had no sense of
her being my daughter or of Edna being my wife.
You would say that after all we three had been through
together, from Passaic up, it would be a sheer impossibility
for there ever to be a sense of strangeness between
us. But there is no limit to the power of the
human soul to cut itself off; intimacy is hard to maintain,
isolation&mdash;alas&mdash;is the natural state. I looked
on them as strangers; I could feel that, in spite of
their clever, resolute forcing, in spite of the hypocrisy
of love for me which each doubtless maintained at all
times with the other, still they could scarcely hide their
feeling that I was a strange man come in from the
street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I liked Crossley,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I think he&#8217;ll
make you a good husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is <i>mad</i> about her!&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;There was
a while this summer when he thought he had lost her,
and he all but went out of his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>To look at her was to believe it; for, a lovelier girl
was never displayed in all her physical perfection by
a more discriminating mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;When is the wedding to be?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>There was a brief, surcharged silence&mdash;no more
than a pause. Then Edna said indifferently, &#8220;As soon
as the settlements are arranged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;is he settling something on her?&#8221; said I,
with pretended innocence. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that. There&#8217;s
been too much of the other sort of thing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Margot came to the rescue with a charming laugh.
&#8220;Poor Hugh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t anything but
mortgages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;I see,&#8221; said I glumly&mdash;and I observed intense
anxiety behind the smiles in those two pairs of
beautiful eyes. &#8220;How much have we got to pay for
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna looked reproachfully at me. &#8220;Margot,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;you&#8217;d better go tell them to serve lunch in fifteen
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said I cheerfully. &#8220;Let her stay.
What&#8217;s the use of this hypocrisy? She knows he cares
no more about her than she cares about him&mdash;that it&#8217;s
simply a matter of buying and selling. If she doesn&#8217;t
know it, if she&#8217;s letting her vanity bamboozle her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey&mdash;please!&#8221; implored Edna. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
smirch the child&#8217;s romance. She and Hugh love
each other. If she were poor, he&#8217;d marry her just the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he offered to go ahead, regardless of settlements?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, papa,&#8221; flashed Margot. &#8220;Things
aren&#8217;t done that way over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they are,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Romantic love
matches occur every day. Even royalty throws up its
rights, to marry a chorus girl. But when there&#8217;s a
fat American goose to pluck and eat, why, they pluck
and eat it. I&#8217;m the goose, my dear&mdash;not you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; murmured Margot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And I wish you didn&#8217;t
have to understand. If possible I want to arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
matters with him so that he&#8217;ll always treat you decently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Godfrey,&#8221; cried Edna in a panic, &#8220;you can&#8217;t
talk money to <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said I. &#8220;He&#8217;s <i>thinking</i> money.
Why shouldn&#8217;t he talk it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows nothing about those things, papa&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll ruin everything!&#8221; cried my wife. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
make us the laughingstock of Europe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We Americans of the rich class are that already,&#8221;
replied I.</p>

<p>Edna must have given her daughter some secret
signal, for she abruptly and hastily left the room,
closing the door behind her. I shrugged my shoulders,
settled back on the exquisitely upholstered and carved
sofa on which I had seated myself. Looking round I
said, &#8220;This is a beautiful room. You&#8217;ve certainly arranged
a fitting background for yourself and Margot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was not listening. She was watching her
fingers slowly twist and untwist the delicate little lace
handkerchief. At last she said: &#8220;Godfrey, I&#8217;ve never
asked a favor of you. I&#8217;ve given my whole life to advancing
your interests&mdash;to making our child a perfect
lady&mdash;and to placing her in a dazzling position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You have worked hard&mdash;and
you&#8217;ve made your tricks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve played my hand well&mdash;as you have yours,&#8221;
said she, accepting my rather unrefined figure with
good grace. &#8220;I began to make Margot&#8217;s career before
she was born. The first time I saw her little face, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
murmured to myself, &#8216;Little Duchess.&#8217; Now, you understand
why I brought her up so carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said I, looking at her with new interest.
&#8220;That was it?&#8221; I who knew what a futile, purposeless,
easily discouraged breed the human race is could
not but admire this woman. If her intelligence had
only been equal to her will, what might she not have
accomplished!</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never lost sight of it for a moment,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;In the early days&mdash;for a time&mdash;when we were
seemingly so hopelessly obscure, and I was too ignorant
to learn which way to turn&mdash;for a while I was discouraged.
But I never gave up&mdash;never! And step by step
I&#8217;ve trained her for the grand position as a leader of
European society she was one day to occupy&mdash;for, I
knew that if she led Europe she would be leader at
home, too. Over there they&#8217;re merely a feeble, crude
echo of Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Socially,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all we&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; replied she.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all there is worth talking about. What else
have you been piling up money for?... What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could think of no reply. I was silent. What else,
indeed?</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept her away from other children,&#8221; Edna went
on. &#8220;After she could talk I never trusted her to nurses
until we could afford fashionable servants. I got her
the right sort of governesses&mdash;so that she should speak
French, Italian, and German, and should have a well-bred
English accent for her own language. I even
trained her in the children&#8217;s stories she read&mdash;had her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
read only the fairy tales and the other stories that
would fill her mind with ideas of nobility and titles and
the high things of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The high things of life,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She made an impressive gesture&mdash;she looked like
a beautiful young empress. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not cant,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Those <i>are</i> the high things of life. Ask any person
you meet in America&mdash;young or old, high or low&mdash;ask
him which he&#8217;d rather be&mdash;a prince, duke, marquis,
or a saint, scientist, statesman. What would he answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;That he&#8217;d rather be a millionaire,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;A millionaire with a title&mdash;with established social
position at the very top&mdash;that couldn&#8217;t be taken away.
That&#8217;s the truth, Godfrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not contradict you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve brought up our daughter
so that she could realize the highest ambition within
our reach. Haven&#8217;t I brought her up well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly, for the purpose,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we came over here, I examined the ground
carefully. I was at first inclined to one of the big Continental
titles. They are much older, much more high
sounding than the English titles&mdash;and so far as birth
goes they mean something, while the English titles mean
really nothing at all. The English aristocracy isn&#8217;t
an aristocracy of birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s, no doubt, the reason why it still has some
say in affairs,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Its talk about birth is almost entirely sham,&#8221; proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
she, not interested in my irrelevant comment.
&#8220;But I found that it was the most substantial aristocracy,
the only one that was respected everywhere,
just as the English money circulates everywhere. And
it&#8217;s the only one that makes much of an impression at
home. We are so ignorant that we think England is
all that it pretends to be&mdash;the powerful part of Europe.
Of course, it isn&#8217;t, but&mdash;no matter. I decided for an
English title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Margot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought her up to respect my judgment,&#8221;
said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what will become of her,&#8221; said I, reflectively,
&#8220;when she hasn&#8217;t you at her elbow to tell her
what to do.... But why a marquis? Why not a
duke?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, blushed a little. &#8220;The only duke we
could have got&mdash;and he was a nice young fellow&mdash;but he
was in love with an English girl of wealth&mdash;and he
wanted too much to change to an American. Is that
frank enough to suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only keep to that key,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted double the American dowry that he
was willing to take with an English girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His being in love with another girl might have
made it unpleasant for Margot,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t have amounted to anything,&#8221; replied
she. &#8220;Over here the right sort of people bring
up their children as I brought up Margot&mdash;to give
their hearts where their hands should go. They are
not shallow and selfish. They think of the family dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and honor before they think of their personal
feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s interesting&mdash;and new&mdash;at least to me,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been judging these things without knowing,
Godfrey,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You have attacked me for
narrowness, when in fact you were the narrow one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? What next?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that the Massingfords&mdash;that&#8217;s the family
name of the Marquis of Crossley&mdash;I found they ranked
higher as a family than any of the ducal families except
one. Of course I don&#8217;t include the royal dukes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said I gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might possibly have got one of the royal dukes&mdash;if
not in England, then here on the Continent. But
I decided&mdash; You see, Godfrey, I looked into everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly have been thorough,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I
should have said it was impossible in so short a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t difficult. All the Americans over
here are well informed about these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can readily believe it,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But why did
you turn down the poor royal dukes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the other women would have made it
dreadfully uncomfortable for Margot. They&#8217;d have
hated her for taking precedence over them by such a
long distance. Then, too&mdash;the dowry. I was afraid
you couldn&#8217;t afford the dowry&mdash;or wouldn&#8217;t think the
title worth the money. Indeed, I didn&#8217;t think so, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A royal duke comes high?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;The least dowry would be seventy-five million
francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen million dollars!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Whew!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Sinkers tried to get one for her daughter for
ten millions&mdash;all she could scrape together. They
agreed to a morganatic marriage for that, but not a full
marriage. So, she and poor Martha gave it up.
Martha&#8217;s heart is broken. The duke made love to her
so wonderfully. I can&#8217;t imagine what Mrs. Sinkers
was about, to allow such a thing before the affair was
settled. Poor Martha was so excited that she would
have accepted the morganatic marriage&mdash;she ranking
merely as the duke&#8217;s head mistress. But while he was
willing to take other mistresses for nothing, and even to
pay them, he wouldn&#8217;t take <i>her</i> for less than fifty million
francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Martha!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was too wise to trifle with royal dukes,&#8221; pursued
Edna, so interested in her own narrative and so eager to
show how sagacious she had been that she forgot her
pose and her doubts as to my sympathies. &#8220;I weighed
the advantages and disadvantages of about a dozen
eligible men. Only three stood the test, and it finally
narrowed down to Crossley. Margot was so happy
when I told her. She wanted to love him&mdash;and now she
is loving him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long pause while Edna calmed down to earth from
her European soarings, and while I, too, returned to the
normal from an excursion in the opposite direction.
&#8220;How much does he want?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get to bed
rock.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;He loves her so that he is willing, so I hear&mdash; Of
course, nothing has been said&mdash; You will not believe
how refined and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; interrupted I.</p>

<p>Edna winced at my rudeness, then again presented an
unruffled front of happy loving serenity. &#8220;Enough to
pay off the mortgages and to provide them with a suitable
income.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; I persisted, laughing.</p>

<p>She looked tenderly remonstrant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,
Godfrey&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know <i>about</i> how much. What&#8217;s the figure&mdash;the
price of this marked down marquis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say the whole thing would not cost more
than three or four million dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three&mdash;or four.&#8221; I laughed aloud. &#8220;Not much
difference there. Now which is it&mdash;three or four?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps nearer four. Margot must have a <i>good</i>
income.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole object would be defeated if she hadn&#8217;t
the means&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;Why use these
evasive words? We&#8217;re talking a plain subject. Let&#8217;s
use its language.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money, then,&#8221; acquiesced she, resolutely good-humored.
&#8220;If she hadn&#8217;t the money to make a proper
appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally, to lead in society you must lead in
spending money.... Well&mdash;it can&#8217;t be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paled, half started from her chair, sank back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
again. There was a long silence. Then she said,
&#8220;You have never been cruel, Godfrey. You won&#8217;t be
cruel now. You won&#8217;t destroy my life work. You
won&#8217;t shatter Margot&#8217;s happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole thing is&mdash;is nauseating to me,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Her short, pretty upper lip quivered. Her eyes
filled. &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t approve, dear, why didn&#8217;t you
stop me long ago? Why did you let me go on until
there was no turning back?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent. There seemed to be no answer to that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you do it purposely, Godfrey?&#8221; said she, with
melancholy eyes upon me. &#8220;Did you lure us on, so
that you could crush us at one stroke?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that of you. I won&#8217;t believe it until
you compel me to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I understand it,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you propose that I
hand over to this young man four million&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only about half of it, Godfrey,&#8221; cried she, reviving.
&#8220;The other half would be Margot&#8217;s&mdash;for her own
income.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that I hand over to this amiable, insignificant
young foreigner two million dollars to induce him to
consent to the degradation of marrying my daughter&mdash;to
have him going about, saying in effect, &#8216;It is true,
she is only one of those low Americans, but don&#8217;t forget
that I got two million dollars for stooping.&#8217; Is that
the proposition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t feel
that he is degrading himself. He feels proud of winning
her&mdash;the most beautiful, the best mannered girl in London.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
But it&#8217;d be simply impossible for them to marry
without the money. <i>I</i> shouldn&#8217;t want it. They would
be wretched. You talk like a sentimental schoolboy,
Godfrey. How could two refined, sensitive people such
as Hugh and Margot, used to every luxury, used to
being foremost in society&mdash;how could they be happy
without the means&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money,&#8221; I corrected blandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without the money needed to maintain their position
as marquis and marchioness of Crossley?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has only about five thousand&mdash;twenty-five
thousand of our money&mdash;a year. That is ridiculous for
a marquis. He has to keep all his houses closed and
run as economically as possible. Even then they cost
him nearly seventy-five thousand dollars a year to maintain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he has only twenty-five thousand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant twenty-five thousand over and above. He
has that to live on. And, poor fellow, he is dropping
every year deeper and deeper into debt. So much is
expected of a marquis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not honesty, apparently,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t judge these people by our commercial
standards,&#8221; she gently rebuked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot,&#8221; said I penitently.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the poor fellow does love Margot so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Have you ever happened to hear
of a Miss Townley&mdash;Jupey Townley?&#8221;</p>

<p>A flash of annoyance flitted over Edna&#8217;s lovely, delicate
countenance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>&#8220;I see you have,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You were, indeed, thorough.
Permit me to compliment you, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad Hugh hasn&#8217;t been a saint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all in the past,&#8221; declared she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw them in a box at a London music hall night
before last,&#8221; said I. &#8220;They were&mdash; They had been
drinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Edna was not daunted. &#8220;You are a man of
the world, Godfrey. Don&#8217;t pretend to be narrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When a man loves a woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love is very different from that sort of thing, and
you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Margot heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey!&#8221; cried Edna, in horror. &#8220;Do you
think I would permit <i>my</i> daughter&mdash;<i>our</i> daughter&mdash;to
know such things! Why, her mind is as pure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not restrain a gesture of disgust. &#8220;You
women!&#8221; I cried, rising. &#8220;Pure! Pure&mdash;God in
Heaven, pure!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her look of dazed astonishment, obviously sincere,
helped me to get back my composure. I sat down again.
&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if you men have no purity yourselves, you
ought to believe in it in women,&#8221; said she, with an injured
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; I agreed heartily. &#8220;I congratulate
you on being able to make such generous allowances for
masculine frailty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sarcastic,&#8221; said she coldly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;No matter. It certainly does not damage the
title&mdash;perhaps adds to its luster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hereditary in their family to be wild up to marriage,
and then to settle down and serve the state in
some distinguished position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;in that case&mdash;&#8221; said I ironically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot and her husband and her children will have
your money some day,&#8221; pursued she. &#8220;Why not give
it to her now, when it will get her happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>That impressed me. &#8220;I have not said I would not
consent to this marriage,&#8221; I reminded her. &#8220;As a matter
of fact, I&#8217;m in favor of it. I can see no future for
Margot in America&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; cried Edna eagerly. &#8220;She simply
couldn&#8217;t marry over there. She&#8217;d be wretched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I feel it is my duty&mdash; Rather late in the day
for me to talk about duty toward my daughter, after
neglecting it all these years. Still, I ought to see to it
that she has the best possible chance for a smooth married
life. It&#8217;s only common prudence to take all precautions&mdash;isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All <i>sensible</i> precautions,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how many of these foreign &#8216;alliances,&#8217;
as they&#8217;re called, have turned out badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They get a good many divorces in the states,&#8221; she
suggested smilingly. &#8220;One to every twelve marriages,
I read the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I admitted that she had made an effective retort.
&#8220;The truth is,&#8221; said I, &#8220;American women aren&#8217;t
brought up for domestic life. So, whether they marry
at home or abroad they have trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;Men resent their independence,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; said I. Of what use to point out
to her that the trouble lay in the women&#8217;s demanding to
be supported and refusing to do anything to earn their
support? All I said was: &#8220;I suspect a good many husbands
think the marriage contract too one-sided&mdash;binding
only them and not their wives. But the trouble with the
&#8216;alliances&#8217; can&#8217;t be that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because Europeans look on the wife as a kind
of head servant. But Hugh isn&#8217;t that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll know more as to that when we hear what
Margot says after she&#8217;s been married a few years,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;The point to settle now is how to bind him to good
behavior so far as it can be done in advance. He may
be deeply in love with Margot. He may stay in love
with her. But in the circumstances it&#8217;s wise to assume
that he wants only her money and that, if he gets it,
he&#8217;ll treat her badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife&#8217;s silence was encouraging.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had plenty of money he might even goad her
into releasing him&mdash;and might marry again.&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife was obviously impressed. &#8220;Yes&mdash;that has
been done,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Of course, if Margot should
have an heir right away. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me as if trying to decide whether she
could trust me with a confidence. She evidently decided
in my favor, for she went on to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand&mdash;Margot is a peculiar girl.
No&mdash;many women have the same peculiarity. They
can&#8217;t be trusted with power over their husbands. If
she had all the money in her own name and he were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
dependent on her&mdash; Godfrey, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;d be
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more she was astonishing me with her clear
judgment in matters as to which I should have thought
her hopelessly prejudiced. &#8220;But <i>I</i> can be trusted,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;The plan I had in mind was to take over the mortgages
and guarantee a sufficient income.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;He won&#8217;t consent,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;His solicitors will insist on better terms than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see why I want to talk to him directly.
I don&#8217;t purpose to be hampered by that old trick of the
principal hidden behind a go-between.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other way,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;They&#8217;re too
clever to yield that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs money badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he won&#8217;t marry unless he&#8217;s actually to get it,&#8221;
replied she. &#8220;Almost every American who has married
a daughter over here has tried to make a business bargain&mdash;at
least, a bargain not altogether one-sided. Not
one of them has succeeded. These Europeans have been
handling the dowry and settlement question too many
centuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said I affably. &#8220;If we want what they&#8217;ve
got, we have to take it on their terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was most satisfactory, talking with her now that
she consented to speak and listen to good sense. I was
at once in a more amiable frame of mind, although I
knew she had descended from her high horse only because
she was shrewd enough to see it was the one way
to get me to do as she wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will hide behind a go-between myself,&#8221; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;Any English lawyer would simply play into the
hands of the other side. At least, so Hilda was telling
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s her husband coming back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a year or so, I believe. Lord Blankenship
cares more for big game and for exploring than for
anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An ideal marriage,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She brought him
the money he wanted. He brought her the title she
wanted. And they don&#8217;t annoy each other. He devotes
himself to sport, she to society. These aristocratic people,
with their simple, vulgar wants that are so easily
gratified&mdash;how they are to be envied!&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna was observing me furtively, uneasily. I pretended
not to notice. I went on: &#8220;Now, if they wanted
the difficult things&mdash;things like love and companionship
and congeniality&mdash;they might be wretched. When a
child cries for a stick of candy or a tinsel-covered rattle&mdash;for
money or social position&mdash;why, it&#8217;s easily pacified.
But if it cries for the moon and the stars&mdash;&#8221;
I laughed softly, enjoying her wonder as much as my
own fancies.</p>

<p>After a while she said, with some constraint: &#8220;You
see a great deal of Armitage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We console each other,&#8221; said I, with mild raillery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been going out much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In one of your letters&mdash; Those rare little notes of
yours! You are cruelly neglectful, Godfrey&mdash; In one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of them you spoke of a week end or so on Armitage&#8217;s
yacht. You and he don&#8217;t go off alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Some literary and artistic people usually
are aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you cared for that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re interesting enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they&#8217;re friends of Mrs. Kirkwood&#8217;s,&#8221;
pursued Edna. &#8220;She&#8217;s like her brother&mdash;affects to
despise fashionable society. Their pretenses always
amused me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are sincere people,&#8221; said I. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
pretend. That&#8217;s why I like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice that Armitage belongs to every fashionable
club in New York&mdash;and to some over here,&#8221; said
Edna with a smile that was as shrewd as her observation.
&#8220;Also, that he manages to find time to appear at the
most exclusive parties during the season.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had observed this same peculiarity. While I refused
to draw from it the inference she drew&mdash;and was
undeniably justified in drawing&mdash;I had been tempted to
do so. It irritated me to see her finger upon the weak
spot in Armitage&#8217;s profession of freedom from snobbishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mary Kirkwood,&#8221; pursued Edna, &#8220;she&#8217;s the
same sort of fakir. Only, being a woman, she does it
more deceptively than he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She goes nowhere,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she revels in the fact that she <i>could</i> go anywhere.
So, she fooled you&mdash;did she?&#8221; Edna laughed
merrily at my ill-concealed discomfiture. &#8220;But then you
know so little about women.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>&#8220;I confess I&#8217;ve never seen in her the least sign of
snobbishness or of interest in fashionable foolishness,&#8221;
said I, with what I flatter myself was a fair attempt at
the impartial air.</p>

<p>&#8220;That in itself ought to have opened your eyes,&#8221;
said Edna. &#8220;Whenever you see anyone, dear, with no
sign of a weakness that everybody in the world has, you
may be sure you are seeing a fraud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because <i>you</i> have a weakness, dear,&#8221; said I&mdash;as
pleasant and as acid as she, &#8220;you must not imagine it
is universal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>you</i> have that weakness, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you or did you not join the fashionable clubs
Armitage put you up at?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to laugh at myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you or are you not proud of the fact that your
best friend, Armitage, is a fashionable person? Would
you be as proud of him if he were only welcome in middle-class
houses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed to say there&#8217;s something in that,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Not much, but something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you believed Mary Kirkwood!&#8221; ended Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought little about it,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And I still
believe that she is sincere&mdash;that she has no snobbishness
in her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You like her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I know her&mdash;yes.&#8221; My answer was an
attempt to meet and parry a suspicion I felt in Edna&#8217;s
mind. And it was fairly successful; fairly&mdash;for no one
ever yet completely dislodged a suspicion. We cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
see into each other&#8217;s minds. We know, from what is
going on in our own minds, that the human mind is capable
of any vagary. Once we have applied this general
principle to a specific person, once we have become definitely
aware that there are in that person&#8217;s mind things
of which we have no knowledge&mdash;from that time forth
suspicion of them is in us, and is ready to grow, to
flourish.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in shifting to the subject of the
marriage. &#8220;I&#8217;ll cable for my lawyer,&#8221; said I. &#8220;If
anyone can beat this game, Fred Norman can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;send for him,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;He is canny&mdash;and
a man of <i>our</i> world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to London to-night&mdash;&#8221; I
went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night!&#8221; she exclaimed. Her eyes filled with
tears. &#8220;Godfrey&mdash;is this treating us right?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her intently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t fake with me,&#8221;
said I quietly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you mean?&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, I understand perfectly that you care nothing
about me, except as the source of the money you
need in amusing yourself. As you see in my manner,
I am not wildly agitated by that fact. So far as I&#8217;m
concerned, there&#8217;s no reason why we should make each
other uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter with you, Godfrey?&#8221; she said,
with large widening eyes gazing at me. &#8220;You have
changed entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have,&#8221; said I, admiring her shrewdness,
and afraid of it. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been educating. So have I.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Mine has been slower than yours and along different
lines. But it, too, has been thorough.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not satisfied, though I&#8217;m confident my tone
and manner betrayed nothing. Said she: &#8220;Some bad
woman has been poisoning you against Margot and
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said I, too wary to be drawn into
that discussion. I realized I had said entirely too much.
Relying upon her intense vanity, her profound belief
in her power over me, I had gone too far. &#8220;My business
takes me to London to-night. I&#8217;ll probably be
there until Norman arrives. Then we&#8217;ll come over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want us in London with you?&#8221; said
Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are comfortably settled here,&#8221; replied I.
&#8220;Why disturb yourselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew how to read me. She saw I was not in
a dangerous mood, as she had begun to fear. She said:
&#8220;We <i>did</i> intend to stay in Paris a month or six weeks.
We have a charming circle of friends among the old
families here. I wish you&#8217;d stop on, Godfrey. The
people are attractive, and the social life is most interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to me,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You forget I&#8217;m a Hooligan.
Besides, you don&#8217;t need me. There&#8217;s your advantage
through being young and lovely and rich. You can
get plenty of men to escort you about. It&#8217;s only the
old and ugly married women who really need their
husbands. Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll be ready when you are forced to
fall back on me. Nothing like having in reserve a faithful
Dobbin.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>She looked hurt. &#8220;How <i>can</i> you joke about sacred
things,&#8221; she reproached.</p>

<p>I laughed her seriousness aside. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll be waiting,
ready to be your companion, the confidant of your
rheumatism and gout, when all the others have fled.
Meanwhile, my dear, I&#8217;ll have my frisk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey!&#8221;</p>

<p>It amused me to see how bitter to her was the taste
of the medicine she had been forcing upon me so self-complacently.
It amused me to watch the confusion
into which these new and unsuspected aspects of myself
was throwing her.</p>

<p>Said I: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re as generous toward me as
I&#8217;ve been toward you. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve avoided the
Armitage sort of smash-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I left Paris that night I&#8217;ll engage she was
thinking about me as she had never thought in her
whole self-centered, American-female life.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> cable to Norman was answered the next day but
one by a note from him, stopping in the same hotel.
I shall not detail the negotiations that followed&mdash;the
long and stormy scenes between him and Dawkins, solicitor
to the Marquis of Crossley. It is sufficient to
say that Norman had the novel sensation of being
beaten on every point. Not outwitted, for he had wit
enough and to spare for any contest of cunning; but
beaten by the centuries-old precedents and customs and
requirements in matters of dower and settlement. The
mercenary marriage is an ancient habit of the human
race; in fact, the scientists have proved that it began
with marriage itself, that there was no marriage in the
civilized sense until there was property to marry for.
Perhaps the mercenary marriage is not so recent in
America as our idyllists declare. Do we not read that
the father of his country married solely for money an
almost feeble-minded woman whom everybody knew he
did not love? And, inasmuch as marriage is first of all
a business&mdash;the business of providing for the material
needs and wants of two and their children&mdash;may it not
barely be possible that the unqualifiedly sentimental view
of marriage can be&mdash;perhaps has been&mdash;overdone? In
America, where the marriage for sentiment prevails to
an extent unknown anywhere else in the world&mdash;is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the institution of marriage there in its most uneasy
state? And may not that be the reason?</p>

<p>What a world of twaddle it is! If men and women
could only learn to build their ideals on the firm foundation&mdash;the
only firm foundation&mdash;of the practical instead
of upon the quicksand of lies and pretenses,
wouldn&#8217;t the tower climb less shakily, if more slowly,
toward the stars?</p>

<p>You may be sure there was nothing of the stars in
those talks between Norman and Dawkins&mdash;or in my
talks with Norman&mdash;or in Crossley&#8217;s talks with Dawkins.
Crossley had had me looked up&mdash;had discovered
as much about my finances as it is possible to discover
about the private business of an American. He had
got the usual exaggerated estimate of my wealth, and
he was resolved that he would not be cheated of a single
dollar he might wring from me. From my standpoint
it was obvious that he and Margot must have plenty of
money or they could not be happy. All I desired was
to prevent him from feeling financially free&mdash;and therefore
under the aristocratic code, morally free&mdash;to show
and to act, after marriage, the contempt I knew he
felt for all things and persons American&mdash;except the
dollars, which could be exchanged into sovereigns. I
fought hard, but he stood fast. Either Margot must
lose him or I must give him about what he asked&mdash;a
fortune in his own right for him. If I choose I could
dower her; but as to dowering him he would not permit
the question of alternative to be raised.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said I at last to Norman. &#8220;Give them
their minimum.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>He was astounded, was furious&mdash;and as he is not
the ordinary lick-spittle lawyer but a man of arrogant
independence, he did not hesitate to let me see that his
anger&mdash;and scorn&mdash;were for myself. &#8220;Do you mean
that?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied I carelessly&mdash;as if I were now indifferent
about the whole business. &#8220;My girl wants his
title. And why let a question of money come between
her and happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t refrain from saying, Loring, that I&#8217;d not
have believed this of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not fit to live in America,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Her
mother hasn&#8217;t educated her for it. American mothers
don&#8217;t educate their daughters nowadays to be wives of
American men. Honestly, do you know an American
man able to do for himself who would be foolish enough
to marry that sort of girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>His silence was assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see. I&#8217;ve got to buy her a husband&mdash;that is,
a title&mdash;over here. This offering seems as good as there
is in the market&mdash;at the price. So&mdash;why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one view of it,&#8221; said he coldly.</p>

<p>I laid my hand on his shoulder. &#8220;Come now&mdash;be
sensible,&#8221; said I. &#8220;What else can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be an impertinence for me to say,&#8221; replied
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can guess,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t trouble
yourself to say it. You evidently don&#8217;t know the circumstances.
And I may add that so long as I&#8217;ve got
to buy Margot a title I might as well buy her a good
one.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>He eyed me sharply. But I did not take him into
my confidence&mdash;nor shall I confide in you at present,
gentle reader. I did not even let him see that I was
holding back anything. I went on with good-humored
raillery:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing better than Hanley or Vanderveld or
Pattison or any of the others who&#8217;ve dealt in these
markets. For a marquis Crossley is selling cheap.
He&#8217;s far from penniless, you know. It&#8217;s simply that
he wants more money. Why, really, old man, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s
called a love match. They always call it a love match
when the nobleman isn&#8217;t absolutely on his uppers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certainly a philosopher, Loring,&#8221; said
Norman, anxious, I saw, to finish and drop the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I became one in the usual way&mdash;necessity,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;I&#8217;m as eager to have this thing dispatched
as you are. I want to get out to sea, where perhaps
the stench of aristocracy will blow out of my nostrils,
and stay out of them till I reach the other shore. Then
I&#8217;ll get it again. It blows down the bay to meet the
incoming ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re pretty bad,&#8221; admitted Norman. &#8220;Not
so bad as we used to be, but pretty bad.&#8221; He laughed.
&#8220;They accuse us of loving money. Why, we are mere
beginners at it. We haven&#8217;t learned how to idle or how
to spend money except in crude, tiresome ways. And to
love money deeply you must know how to idle and how
to spend. Money&#8217;s <i>the</i> passion with these people.
How they do need it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither shall I linger over the details of the engagement
and the wedding. For all that was important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
about either I refer you to the newspapers of London
and New York. They gave everything that makes a
snob&#8217;s eyes glisten and a snob&#8217;s mouth water. My wife
has somewhere&mdash;she knows exactly where&mdash;a scrapbook,
and my daughter has another of the same kind. Those
scrapbooks are strongly bound and the pages are of
the heaviest time- and wear-resisting paper. In them
are pasted columns on columns of lists of titles, of
descriptions of jewels and dresses, of enumerations of
wedding gifts. Margot received things costing small
fortunes from people she barely knew well enough to
invite. They gave in the hope&mdash;the good hope&mdash;of
gaining the valuable favor of the Marchioness of Crossley,
a great lady by reason of her title, a greater lady
by reason of the ancientness of the Massingford family,
and at the top and summit of greatness by reason of
her wealth.</p>

<p>That last item, by the way, was vastly overestimated.
Everyone assumed that Crossley had sold much more
dearly. No one but those intimately concerned dreamed
what a bargain I had got.</p>

<p>You may be picturing a sordid affair, redolent of
the stenches of commercialism. If you are, gentle
reader, you are showing yourself unworthy of your own
soulfulness, unworthy of the elegant society into which
I have introduced you. I have been giving simply the
plain facts&mdash;a mere skeleton upon which you, versed
in society columns and society novels, and skilled in the
art of hiding ugly truths under pretty lies, may readily
drape the flesh and the garments of sentimentality and
snobbishness. You will then have the truth as it appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
to the world&mdash;a handsome, manly groom, every
inch of him the patrician; a wondrous lovely, innocent,
pure young bride, looking the worthy mate of the great
noble she had won with her beauty and her sweetness;
a background of magnificent houses and equipages, of
grand society people, of lackeys in livery without number;
an atmosphere of luxury, refinement, perfumed
with the fairest flowers and the most delicate artificial
scents. You are seeing also the high and noble motives
of all concerned&mdash;the joy of parents in a daughter
sentimentally wooed and won to happiness; the generous
and kindly feelings of all the friends; the lavish and
affectionate overflowing of costly gifts; above all, the
ecstatic young couple wrapped up in their love for
each other. Flesh up and beautify the skeleton to your
taste, gentle reader. You will not go amiss.</p>

<p>I must linger a moment on the happiness of my
daughter. It was too spiritual to be of this earth. As
soon as the miserable, unimportant money matters were
settled, and her mother gave her full leave to love, she
threw herself into it with all the ardor of the heroine
of a novel. She had two diamond hearts made&mdash;at the
most fashionable jewelers in Paris, you may be sure.
Upon the inside of the one she kept she had engraved,
under his picture, &#8220;From Hugh to Margot.&#8221; In the
one she gave him there surrounded her picture in diamond
inlay, &#8220;To Hugh from his dear love Margot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each was to wear the heart round the neck until
death. Again and again I caught her dreaming over
hers, sometimes with tears in her limpid eyes. Again
and again I caught her scribbling, &#8220;Margot, Marchioness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
of Crossley, Viscountess Brear, Countess of Felday
and Noth, Baroness de Selve,&#8221; and so on through a
list of titles which gentle reader will find in &#8220;Burke&#8217;s&#8221;
and the &#8220;Almanach de Gotha.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she had a reverent way of looking at him and
a tender way of touching him. Her mother, you will
believe, spared neither expense nor pains in getting
together the trousseau. But Margot was not satisfied.
&#8220;Not nearly fine enough for <i>his</i> bride,&#8221; she would say.
&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> afraid he&#8217;ll be disappointed.&#8221; Then the tears
would spring. &#8220;Oh, mamma! If he should be disappointed
in me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bad as if you were to be disappointed in
him,&#8221; I put in with no other motive than to cheer her up.</p>

<p>But it only shocked her. &#8220;In Hugh!&#8221; she exclaimed,
meaning in Cecil Robert Grunleigh Percival
Hugh Massingford, Marquis of Crossley, etc. &#8220;<i>I</i> disappointed
in <i>him</i>! Oh, papa! You don&#8217;t <i>realize</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; said I, getting myself away as
speedily as my legs would carry me.</p>

<p>Through these joyous scenes of youth and love and
luxury I moved gloomily&mdash;restless, bitter, tormented by
self-reproaches and by thoughts of the woman I loved.
What Edna had said about her, though I knew it was
by way of precautionary cattishness, put into my mind
the inevitable suspicion&mdash;no, not actual suspicion, but
germ of suspicion&mdash;the almost harmless germ from
which the most poisonous suspicions may develop. I
went round and round my mental image of Mary Kirkwood.
I viewed it from all angles. But I could not
find a trace of the flaw Edna had asserted. I analyzed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
her with all the analytical skill I possessed, and that, I
flatter myself, is not a little. No one who has not the
faculty of analysis ever gets anywhere; no one who has
that faculty ever escapes the charge of cynicism. Shallow
people&mdash;the sort that make such a charge&mdash;will
regard it as proof of my utter cynicism, my absolute
lack of sentiment, that I was able to analyze the woman
I loved, or pretended I loved. But I assure you, gentle
reader, that not even love and passion suspend the habitual
processes of a good mind. The reason you have
read the contrary so often is because precious few
writers about men of the superior sort have the capacity
to comprehend the intellects they try to picture. To
the man of large affairs, the average&mdash;and many a one
above the average&mdash;biography or novel about a great
man reads like the attempt of a straddle bug to give his
fellow straddle bugs an account of an elephant.</p>

<p>I was the only inharmonious figure in that round of
festivals. But no one observed me. I simply got the
reputation of being a man of reserve, a thinker rather
than a talker&mdash;as if there ever lived a thinker who did
not overflow with torrents of talk like a spring fed from
a glacier; but, of course, the spring flows only when
The conditions are favorable, not when it is ice-bound.
I was not even interested in observing. There is a
monotony about the actions of fashionable people that
soon reduces a spectator of agile mind to stupor. The
same thing over and over again, with variations so
slight that only a nit-wit would be interested in them&mdash; Could
there be a worse indictment of the intelligence of
the human race than that so large a part of its presumably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
most intelligent classes engage in the social
farce, which is an example of aimless activity about on
a level with a dog&#8217;s chasing its own tail?</p>

<p>But Edna&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As I look back on those weeks of days, each one
crowded like a ragbag with rubbish, the figure of Edna
stands out radiant. You would never have thought her
the mother of the bride&mdash;or, indeed, a mother at all.
A woman who for many years leads a virginal or almost
virginal life gets back the vestal air of the unmarried
girl. This air had returned to Edna. She had it as
markedly as had Margot. It was most becoming to
her piquant style of beauty, giving it the allure of the
height that invites ascent and capture, yet has never
been desecrated. And how she did enjoy the grandeur&mdash;the
great names, the gorgeous presents of curiously
and costlily wrought gold and silver and crystal,
and precious stones, the succession of panoramas of
ultra-fashionable life, with herself and Margot always
the center.</p>

<p>I used to stand aside and watch her and feel as if
I were hypnotized into vivid hallucinations. I recalled
the incidents of our early life&mdash;Brooklyn, the Passaic
flat, the squat and squalid homes of our childhood. I
recalled our people&mdash;hers and mine&mdash;tucked away in
homely obscurity among the New Jersey hills. But by
no effort of mind could I associate her with these realities.
She had literally been born again. I looked at
the other Americans of humble beginnings&mdash;and there
were not a few of them in that society. All had retained
some traces of their origin, had some characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
that made it not difficult to connect their present
with their past. But not Edna.</p>

<p>At the wedding&mdash;in the most fashionable church in
the West End&mdash;Margot looked weary and rather old,
gone slightly stale from too long and hard preliminary
training. Edna was at her best&mdash;delicate, fragile, radiant.
How the other women hated her for that time-defying
beauty of hers! Many of the women of her still
youthful age retained much of the physical attractiveness
of youth. But there was not another one who was
not beginning to show the effects of dissipation&mdash;of too
much food and wine and cigarettes, of lives devoid of
elevating sensations, of minds used only for petty, mean
thoughts. But Edna seemed in the flower of that period
when the secrets of the soul have as yet made no marks
upon the countenance. You would have said she was a
merry and romantic girl. I could not fathom that
mystery. I cannot fathom it now. Its clew must be
in her truly amazing powers of self-deception and also
in that unique capacity of hers for forgetting the thing,
no matter what, that is disagreeable to remember.</p>

<p>When we were at last alone, with the young couple
off for the yacht Lord Shangway had loaned them for
the honeymoon, with the last guest gone and the last
powdered flunkey vanished&mdash;when she and I were alone,
she settled herself with a sigh and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could make it begin all over again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be built of steel,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am supremely happy,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and have been
for weeks. Nothing agrees with me so thoroughly as
happiness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>I looked at her scrutinizingly. No, she was not the
least tired; she was as fresh as if that moment risen from
a long sleep in the air of seashore or mountains.</p>

<p>She went on: &#8220;I&#8217;m going over to Paris to-morrow.
I&#8217;ve a lot of engagements there. And I must get some
clothes. I&#8217;ve worn out all I brought with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worn out&#8221; meant worn once or at most twice;
for in a society where everyone is seeing everyone else
all the time a woman with a reputation for dress cannot
afford to reappear in clothes once seen. In some circles
this would sound delightfully prodigal, in others delightfully
impossible, and perhaps in still others delightfully
criminal. But then all that sort of thing is relative&mdash;like
everything else in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come along?&#8221; said she in a perfunctory
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m off for Russia with
a party of bankers to look at some mining properties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were returning to New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for several months,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you stay away so long from your beloved
America?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business&mdash;always business.&#8221;</p>

<p>She eyed me somewhat as one eyes a strange, mildly
interesting specimen. &#8220;Well&mdash;you must enjoy it, or
you wouldn&#8217;t keep at it year in and year out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One has to pass the time,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does Mary Kirkwood pass the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>This unexpected and&mdash;except sub-consciously&mdash;accidental
question, staggered me for an instant. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much about it,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She has a house&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
she looks after it, herself. She reads, I believe.
She has gardens&mdash;and they use up a lot of time. Then
she rides.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna yawned. &#8220;It sounds dull,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
domestic people are always dull. And she is certainly
domestic. I wonder why she doesn&#8217;t marry again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are any men attentive to her? It seems to me I
heard something about a novelist&mdash;some poor man who
is after her money.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was choking with rage and jealousy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see any such man about?&#8221;</p>

<p>I contrived to compose myself for a calm reply.
&#8220;No one answering to your description,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked me that once before,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I forgot. It seems to me you and she would
have exactly suited each other. You like domestic
women. That is, you think you do. Really, you&#8217;d
probably fly from a woman of that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a woman of the other sort would fly from
me,&#8221; said I, laughing.</p>

<p>She looked at me thoughtfully. &#8220;You must admit
you&#8217;re not easy to get on with&mdash;except at a distance,&#8221;
observed she. &#8220;But men of positive individuality are
never easy to get on with. A big tree blights all the
little trees and bushes that try to grow in its neighborhood....
No, Godfrey dear, you weren&#8217;t made for
domestic life&mdash;you and I. Domestic life is successful
only where there are two very small and very much
alike. People like us have to live alone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>I rose abruptly. There was for me a sound in that
&#8220;alone&#8221; like the slam of a graveyard gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never will appreciate me&mdash;how satisfactory
I&#8217;ve been,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;until you marry again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must make my final arrangements for Russia,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I see you in the morning? I&#8217;m leaving
rather early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll meet when you come back. We&#8217;ll visit
Margot at Sothewell Abbey.&#8221; She rose, drew herself
to her full height with a graceful gesture of triumph.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you honestly rather like it, being the father of
a Marchioness?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not speak. I looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How solemn you are!&#8221; laughed she. &#8220;Well,
good-by, dear.&#8221; And she held out her hand and turned
her face upward for me to kiss her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll probably see you in the morning,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;or to-night.&#8221; And away I went.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From Russia I drifted to India, intending to return
home by the Pacific. At Bombay I met Lord Blankenship,
and he persuaded me to cross to East Africa. I
found him a companion exactly to my taste. He was
a silent chap having nothing to think about and nothing
to think with&mdash;a typical and model product of the
aristocratic education that completes a man as a sculptor
completes an image, and prepares him to stand in
his appointed niche until decay tumbles him down as
rubbish. I had lost all my former passion for talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
and listening. I wished to confine myself&mdash;my thoughts&mdash;to
the trivial matters of the senses, to lingering over
and tinkering with the physical details of life. The
silent and vacant Blankenship set me a perfect example,
one easy to fall into the habit of following.</p>

<p>At Paris, I picked up my private secretary, Markham,
and resumed attention to my affairs. I had arranged
for things to go on without me, when I set out
for East Africa. I found that my guess as to how they
would go had been correct. For a month or so there
was confusion&mdash;the confusion that is inevitable when a
man who has attended to everything abruptly throws
up his leadership. Then the affairs in which he fancied
himself indispensable begin to move as well as if
he were at the throttle&mdash;perhaps better. The most
substantial result of my neglect seemed to be that I
had become much richer, had more than recovered what
my purchase of a son-in-law had cost me.</p>

<p>Markham, who had been at Cairo two months, had
got himself engaged to be married. For several years
I had been promising him a good position, that is to
say, one more fitting a grown man of real capacity.
But he made himself so useful that I put off redeeming
my promise and eased my conscience and quieted his
ambition with a succession of increases of salary.
Now, however, I could no longer delay releasing him.
So I must go back to New York, to find some one to take
his place. Blankenship was wavering between a trip
through West Africa and going to America with me,
on the chance of my accompanying him on a shooting
trip through British Columbia. He decided to stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
to me, and as I had grown thoroughly used to having
him about I was rather glad. It is astonishing how
much comfort one can get out of the society of a silent
man, when one feels that he is a good fellow and a devoted
friend.</p>

<p>I telegraphed Edna that I would be unable to come
to London, where she then was. But she defeated my
plan for not seeing her. When I reached Paris there
she was waiting for me at the Ritz. She had a swarm
of French, Italians, and English about her&mdash;I believe
there were some Germans or Austrians, also. I refused
to be annoyed with them, and we dined quietly with
Blankenship, Markham, and a pretty little Countess de
Salevac to act us buffers between us. I tried to avoid
being left alone with her, but she would not have it so.
She insisted on my coming to her sitting room after
the others had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are tired,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but I shan&#8217;t detain
you long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; said I. &#8220;The journey has knocked
me out. I&#8217;ve not slept for two nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to worry you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I made for the door. &#8220;Not to-night&mdash;no worries.
They&#8217;ll keep until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Godfrey dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I must tell you
at once. There is serious trouble between Margot and
Hugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they haven&#8217;t been married a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been treating her shamefully from the
outset. In fact, he cut short the honeymoon to hurry
back to that music-hall person.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;The one I saw him with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;the same one&mdash;that notorious Jupey
What&#8217;s-her-name. Isn&#8217;t it dreadful! Margot&#8217;s pride
is up in arms. Nothing I say will quiet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;She refuses to understand that over here husbands
are allowed a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Latitude,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;More latitude than in America. I have talked
with Hugh, too. He is&mdash;very difficult. Really, he isn&#8217;t
at all as he seemed. He is a&mdash;he is horribly coarse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People who think of nothing but how to get money
without work and how to spend it without usefulness
are apt to be coarse, when you probe through to the
reality of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is&mdash;defiant,&#8221; pursued she, too femininely practical
to have interest in or patience with philosophy.
&#8220;He&mdash; Godfrey, he says he hates her. He won&#8217;t
speak to her. And there&#8217;s no prospect of an heir. He
says he wants to get rid of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>These successive admissions of a worse and worse
mess were forced from her by my air of indifference.
&#8220;What has <i>she</i> done?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done? I don&#8217;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has she done to drive him to extremes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey!&#8221; she cried in a shocked tone. &#8220;<i>You</i>&mdash;taking
sides against your daughter&mdash;your only
child! Have you no paternal feeling, either?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve seen little of
Margot&mdash;not enough to get acquainted with her. And
you educated her so that we are uncongenial. No&mdash;since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
you set me to thinking, I find I haven&#8217;t much paternal
feeling for her. I used to have in Passaic, when
I wheeled her about the streets on Sundays.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused to enjoy the shame my wife was struggling
with.</p>

<p>&#8220;But soon after we moved to Brooklyn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna winced and shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sent her away to begin to be a lady. And
a lady she is&mdash;and ladies are not daughters&mdash;are not
women even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must help me, Godfrey,&#8221; said Edna, after a
strained silence. &#8220;Margot is wretched, and a dreadful
scandal may break out in time. Already people are
talking. Margot is ashamed to show herself in public.
She thinks everyone is laughing at her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt she&#8217;s right,&#8221; said I. &#8220;A woman who
loses her husband on the honeymoon is likely to be laughed
at.... What did she do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you persist in saying that?&#8221; cried she,
so irritated that she could not altogether restrain herself.
&#8220;Your dislike of women has become a mania
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t dislike them,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;On the contrary,
I like them&mdash;like them so well that their worthlessness
angers me like the treachery of a friend. And
I believe so much in their power that, when things go
wrong, I blame them. They have dominion over the
men and over the children. And whenever they use their
powers it is to make fools of the men and weaklings of
the children. I don&#8217;t know which is the worse influence&mdash;the
wishy-washy, unpractical, preacher morality of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
good woman or the lazy, idle, irresponsible dissipation of
the&mdash;the ladies and near-ladies and lady-climbers and
lady-imitators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this has nothing to do with poor Margot!&#8221;
exclaimed she impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything to do with her,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Still&mdash;it&#8217;s
a spilt pail of milk. As for the present&mdash;and future&mdash; How
can I do anything to help her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t, if you condemn her unheard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t condemn her. I am simply recognizing that
there are two sides to this quarrel. And I assure you,
you only make matters worse when you interfere without
recognizing that fact. So I say again, what did <i>she</i>
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife calmed slightly and replied: &#8220;He says she
made him ridiculous with the airs she put on.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;After the education you gave her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Blame me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And aren&#8217;t you to be blamed?&#8221; urged I. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you have full charge of her from the time she was born?
Couldn&#8217;t you have made what you pleased of her?
Didn&#8217;t you make what you pleased of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna tossed her head indignantly. &#8220;I never taught
her to be a vulgar snob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought that was her whole education.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna ignored this interruption. &#8220;It&#8217;s all very well
for the women of noble families to act the snob,&#8221; pursued
she. &#8220;Lots of them do, and no one criticises. But
Margot ought to have had sense enough to realize that
she, a mere American, couldn&#8217;t afford to do it. I warned
her that her cue was sweetness and an air of equality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
I told her that her title in itself would keep people at
their proper distance. But she lost her head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the thing for her to do is to behave herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late, I&#8217;m afraid. The tide has turned
against her. All the women&mdash;especially the titled English
women of good family&mdash;were against her&mdash;hated
her&mdash;were ready to stab her in the back. And her
haughtiness and condescension gave them the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you propose? To give him more
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna showed none of her familiar scorn of sordid
things. She reflected, said uncertainly: &#8220;I wonder
would that do any good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To win anyone give them what they most want,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;What do your friends over here want above
everything and anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; confessed she. Consider,
gentle reader, what this confession involved, how it exposed
the rotten insincerity of all her and her fine friends&#8217;
pretenses. &#8220;Yes, I guess you&#8217;re right, Godfrey.&#8221; She
pressed her hands to her temples. &#8220;It simply <i>must</i> be
straightened out. I am quite distracted. I can&#8217;t afford
to lose sleep and to be harrowed up. Those things mean
ruin to a woman&#8217;s looks. And what <i>would</i> I do if she
were flung back on my hands in this disgraceful fashion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to go to London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey, you <i>must</i> go. You must see her, and him,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking it would be enough to see him. But
perhaps you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>&#8220;She is clean mad,&#8221; cried Edna, with sudden fury
against her daughter. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t appreciate the peril
of her position. One minute she&#8217;s all for groveling. The
next she talks like an idiot about her rank and power.
Oh, she is a fool&mdash;a <i>fool</i>! I always knew she was&mdash;though
I wouldn&#8217;t admit it to myself. You never will
know what a time I&#8217;ve had training her to hide it
enough to make a pleasing appearance. She is a brainless
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fool, but not brainless,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Her education
made her a fool and paralyzed her brain. You see,
she didn&#8217;t have the advantages you had in your early
training. In your early days you had the chance to
learn something&mdash;the useful things that have saved you
from the consequences of such folly as you&#8217;ve taught
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; cried Edna in disgust. &#8220;But
we mustn&#8217;t quarrel. I&#8217;m agitated enough already. You
will go to London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I, after reflecting. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I firmly. &#8220;Either I manage this affair
alone or I have nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Godfrey, there are so many things about
these people that you don&#8217;t understand. And you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand the essential thing,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And
that is their mania for money.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was on the verge of hysteria&mdash;afraid I would
not go, afraid of what I would do if I did go. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
they have to be handled carefully,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;If you
put them in a position where their pride won&#8217;t let them
take the&mdash;the money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Go to bed, sleep soundly,
and trust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood. She suddenly flung herself against my
breast and began to sob on my shoulder. &#8220;You are
hard and cold,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have no sympathy with
me&mdash;no feeling for anything but business. But somehow&mdash;in
spite of it all&mdash;I have such a sense of your
strength and your honesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed rather awkwardly, patted her shoulder,
helped her to a chair. &#8220;There are times when a coarse,
common American business man of a husband has his
uses&mdash;and advantages,&#8221; I said lightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll telegraph
you how things are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dried her eyes, looked at me in a puzzled way.
&#8220;You always repulse me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciate your kindness in remembering to toss
a few crumbs to the starving man,&#8221; laughed I. &#8220;They
are precious crumbs, no doubt, and more than he deserves.
But&mdash;please don&#8217;t do it. He hates that sort of
thing. You are free to act as you feel like acting. I&#8217;ll
do as much for you and Margot without the crumbs as
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How hard you are, Godfrey! How you have always
misunderstood me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said I amiably. &#8220;I&#8217;m too coarse
for such a fine nature. Well&mdash;good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took myself hastily away to bed; and at ten the
next morning I departed for London.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>I decided to see Margot first. She was at Sothewell
Abbey, about an hour by express from Paddington. You
perhaps know Sothewell Abbey through the pictures and
descriptions. And it is indeed an imposing pile of old
masonry seated in the midst of a park of surpassing
beauty. As soon as I entered the ancient gates for the
two-mile drive to the Abbey, I saw signs that my money
was in action. When I first visited it, the lodge was in
sad disrepair, the gates were about to fall to pieces and
the vista of the drive was unkempt. Now, all was
changed. The servile pair who came out to open for
me, and made me fear they would drop down on their
bellies and crawl before me, were neatly and properly
dressed, in strong contrast to their former appearance.</p>

<p>The exterior of the house, which had been most &#8220;romantic&#8221;
but obviously the front of poverty and decay,
looked much better&mdash;not younger I hasten to assure you,
quiet reader, but somewhat like a hairless, toothless old
man when he gets a nice white wig on his pate and a
set of good false teeth on his shriveled gums. I saw
gardeners at work&mdash;and plenty there was for them to do.
Within, I saw evidences of a more adequate staff of
servants; but the great halls were dreary and bare and
dingy. That was a cold summer in England, even colder
than the summer usually is. So, the enormous house was
literally uninhabitable, like all the European palaces,
city and country, that I have been in. I can fancy what
such a place must be in winter with no way of heating it
but open fireplaces, and not many of them. I can&#8217;t conceive
any sane American, used to comfort in the way of
steam heat, spending a winter in the English country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
I know it is done by Americans reputedly sane; but if
those at home knew what Europe in winter meant&mdash;the
old-fashioned &#8220;romantic&#8221; Europe&mdash;they would not believe
their expatriated countrymen sane in sacrificing
comfort and health to vanity. Yes, I believe they would;
for, do not they, at home, make the same imbecile sacrifices
to vanity in other ways?</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me to some small warm room,&#8221; said I to Margot,
&#8220;before I catch my death of cold.&#8221; This the instant
I was within doors and felt in my very marrow
the clammy chill of that picturesque vaulted hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any warm room in the house,&#8221; replied
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the kitchen?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She looked alarmed&mdash;being her mother&#8217;s own daughter,
in lack of the sense of humor as in many other ways.
She said hastily: &#8220;The upstairs rooms are a little better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t be worse. These rooms are cold
storage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting used to it,&#8221; said she. &#8220;One doesn&#8217;t
mind it so much after a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her nose was red and swollen, and her voice husky.
She had a frightful cold at that very moment. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you get out of here and go to a decent modern
hotel in town?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give up possession!&#8221; cried she in horror. &#8220;He
might not let me come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was too ridiculous. &#8220;Possession of what?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>papa</i>!&#8221; cried she, in despair and shame at my
coarse stupidity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>&#8220;Possession of what?&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;Of a dirty,
dingy old cold-storage plant. Why should you want
to come back? Put on your wraps and let&#8217;s fly to town
by the next train.&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into tears. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather die!&#8221; she sobbed.
&#8220;I <i>won&#8217;t</i> give up my position. I am Marchioness of
Crossley and I belong here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try the smaller
rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>She led me up a vast stairway&mdash;it would have thrilled
your soul, gentle reader. Think how it sounds, put into
the fitting language&mdash; &#8220;The beautiful young Marchioness
conducted her father up the ancient and magnificent
stairway that rose from the spacious medi&aelig;val
hall and swept in a curve of wonderfully wrought stone
work, dating from the thirteenth century, to the upper
chambers of the majestic old abbey.&#8221; I hurried her as
fast as I could, for we both were sneezing and a hideous
draught like the breath of death was streaming from
somewhere. I don&#8217;t mind looking at pictures of abbeys
and the like; but when I read of the grandeur of living
in that sort of place, I laugh. The men who built them
did as well as they could in the age they lived in. But
what shall be said of men who dwell in them now, when
infinitely better is to be had?</p>

<p>Those upper chambers! Cold, clammy, draughty&mdash;the
furniture and hangings old and dowdy. And my
daughter&#8217;s room! Like a squalid, decrepit tenement
flat. Yes, squalid; for the rugs and draperies were
dirty, were stained and frayed. There was a distinct
tenement odor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fascinating?&#8221; said she, gazing round with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the fire?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She led me to a smelly, low-ceilinged little room, like
a segment out of a hovel. It was her boudoir, she informed
me. In one wall, in a dinky fireplace burned a
handful of fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must remember, papa,&#8221; said she proudly,
&#8220;that this isn&#8217;t a <i>modern</i> house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ring for a servant,&#8221; said I. &#8220;This overcoat of
mine is too light. I must have wraps if I&#8217;m to sit here.
And you&#8217;d better get out your furs and put them on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The servants&#8217;d think me mad,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Must
you have a coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;that spread will do,&#8221; said I. And I jerked
it from the sofa and flung it round my shoulders. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to upset your establishment. Good God, I
had no idea people with any money at all anywhere on
earth lived like this. If you&#8217;re going to stay here, you
must put in steam heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we couldn&#8217;t do that, papa dear,&#8221; said she with
a plaintive mingling of shame for me and apology for
the tradition against sense and health.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get to business, Margot,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Sit in
the fireplace&mdash;that&#8217;s right. What&#8217;s the trouble? Your
mother has explained&mdash;has told all she knew. I&#8217;ve come
to find what the quarrel is <i>really</i> about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she told you of that woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he go back to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to sob. &#8220;Oh, the hideous things he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to me! I didn&#8217;t dream a gentleman could talk like that.
He called me a low American&mdash;said he was ashamed of
me&mdash;said he was going to get rid of me at any cost,
said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what had you <i>done</i>!&#8221; interrupted I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; she cried, lifting her flushed face.
&#8220;Absolutely nothing&mdash;except worship him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What had you done?&#8221; I repeated. As she started
to rise I restrained her. &#8220;Stay in the fireplace. What
was the beginning of the row&mdash;the very beginning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes wavered, but she said: &#8220;Nothing, papa!&#8221;
though less vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about money,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It always is&mdash;in
all ranks of society. The beginnings of the quarrels
have money at the bottom of them. Now&mdash;tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help you unless you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was so sordid!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;And I thought
him high above those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one that&#8217;s human is,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Any person
who wears pants or skirts that have to be paid for is not
above money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted me to turn over to him all I had,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;Think of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have known,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said it was beneath his dignity as an English
gentleman to have a wife independent of him. And, do
you know, papa, I was so infatuated that I almost
yielded. I could see his point of view. And I&#8217;d have
been glad to come to him for every cent. Only&mdash;&#8221; She
stopped short.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>&#8220;Only what?&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard about that other woman. And his way of
treating me&mdash; He said it was the proper way for a
marquis to treat his marchioness. And I liked the dignity
and the beauty of it all, when others were about.
But it seemed to me that when we were alone&mdash; Oh,
papa, I can&#8217;t tell you these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was&mdash;a little jealous, away down in my
heart&mdash;and suspicious. And I was afraid he wanted
the money to spend on <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t tell your mother
this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hates sordidness of every kind,&#8221; said Margot.
&#8220;And I hadn&#8217;t the courage. Besides, I&#8217;m sure mamma
would have advised me to let him have his way. She
wouldn&#8217;t sympathize with the&mdash;the weak side of my
character.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was interested. Could it be that Edna&#8217;s daughter
had a &#8220;weak&#8221;&mdash;a human side? Could it be that her
education and her mode of life had not altogether killed
the natural and made her soul a garden of artificial
flowers only?</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you want to be free from him?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Free from him!&#8221; cried she, aghast. &#8220;Give up my
position? Oh, papa&mdash;never&mdash;<i>never</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t love him. Don&#8217;t come away from
that fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>She seated herself by the miserable smoky little blaze
again. &#8220;He is my husband. I am his wife. I am the
Marchioness of Crossley.&#8221; And she drew herself up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
with as much of an air as her cold and the contracted
space in the chimney-piece permitted. Unluckily, the
sudden gesture caused a current of air, and she sneezed
once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get those furs,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You want the
man back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. I must have him back.&#8221; She
clasped her hands and wailed, &#8220;If I only had a son!
Then&mdash;<i>then</i> I&#8217;d show Hugh that he couldn&#8217;t trample on
me. But he has me in his power now. If he casts me
off I shan&#8217;t have any position at all. The women are
down on me. They hate all the American women, except
those who toady to them and give them money or
jewelry or pay their bridge and dressmaker&#8217;s bills. And
they&#8217;re only too glad of the chance to crush me. But
they&#8217;ll not succeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said I dryly.</p>

<p>She burst into tears. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know what to
do! Papa, shall I give him the money?&mdash;sign over all
my income to him and take only what he&#8217;ll allow me?
And would he come back if I did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would not,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;what <i>shall</i> I do? Oh, what slaves we
women are! Think of it, papa! He wants to make
a <i>slave</i> of me&mdash;said he didn&#8217;t believe in women
gadding about and showing themselves off in costly
dresses and causing scandalous talk&mdash;said my place
was at home&mdash;looking after the house and that sort
of thing!&#8221; She laughed wildly. &#8220;Like a low, common
servant! And he&mdash;he free to carry on with that
woman!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;You might teach him to stay at home, if you set
him a good example,&#8221; suggested I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to stay at home!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t marry for that. I want to enjoy all the privileges
of my rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t brought up to be like a low, middle-class
woman, or a workingman&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You are a lady. You&#8217;re
made, not to be of use in the world, but to enjoy yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed to find some cause for dissatisfaction in
my enthusiastic tone. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall
do my duty as a member of the high nobility&mdash;lead in
society and open bazars and visit the poor on our estate
and&mdash;and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And the world being what
it is, there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can bring him back, papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends on you,&#8221; said I warily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything&mdash;anything. I&#8217;ll crawl to him, if
he wants me to. After all, he <i>is</i> the Marquis of Crossley,
and I&#8217;m only an American nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the proper spirit,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But you
mustn&#8217;t show it to him <i>too</i> plainly. Be moderate. A
little pretense of dignity&mdash;of self-respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said she seriously&mdash;she was indeed
Edna&#8217;s own daughter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be as I was before we were
married.&#8221; Her eyes flashed. &#8220;Oh, I can bide my time.
When I have a son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get ready and come up to town to-night,&#8221; said I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
with a most unfatherly gruffness and curtness, I fear.
&#8220;I&#8217;m off now to deal with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful not to wound his pride, papa,&#8221; she
cautioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I realize the danger of that,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Come
to the Savoy. Be on hand, so I can get hold of you
whenever I need you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa <i>dear</i>!&#8221; she cried, and cast herself into
my arms.</p>

<p>I brushed my lips upon her crown of hair&mdash;it was
false hair, that being the fashion of the day. &#8220;Try to
make yourself as pretty as you can,&#8221; said I, releasing
her and myself. &#8220;You&#8217;ll hear from me to-night or to-morrow,
unless I&#8217;ve caught my death in this damp cave.
You must leave it to the frogs, and snakes, and bats,
and build yourself a decent house somewhere. You&#8217;ll
die here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Hugh wouldn&#8217;t consent to <i>live</i> anywhere
but here. It&#8217;s the ancestral seat, you know.
The Massingfords have lived here since forever and
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have died here, you mean. Have killed wives they
wanted to get rid of, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She startled&mdash;looked excitedly at me. &#8220;Papa!&#8221;
she exclaimed breathlessly. &#8220;Yes&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t put it
past him!&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath of relief. &#8220;Oh, you weren&#8217;t
in earnest,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;But&mdash;don&#8217;t live here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t,&#8221; said she firmly. &#8220;It&#8217;s dreadful for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
looks. You&#8217;ve seen what so many of these English
women look like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like shriveled, frost-bitten apples,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t die because they&#8217;re used to it. But it&#8217;s
death for people accustomed to civilization. Not even
the steady glow of pride in your title and position can
keep you heated up enough to save you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give Hugh a house, if he&#8217;ll consent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Until to-night or to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I fled from the romantic old Abbey, but not soon
enough to avoid what was threatening to be the cold of
my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moment I was in London, and before that
Sothewell Abbey cold had a chance to grip me, I went
at it. Starve, stay in bed, and keep the air out for a day&mdash;that&#8217;s
the way to put a cold out of business. Unless
it be some occasional prodigy endowed with superhuman
common sense and self-restraint, no one learns how to
take care of his health except by experience. The doctors
know precious little about disease; about health they
know nothing&mdash;naturally, they have no interest in health.
The average human being not only does not know how
to take care of his health, but also does not wish to learn
how; health involves self-denial, cutting down on food,
drink, tobacco and the other joys of life. So he who
wishes to avoid enormous payments in discomfort and
pain for slight neglects and transgressions of physical
laws has to work it out for himself. I&#8217;ve made several
valuable discoveries in the science and art of living; about
the most valuable of them is that every illness starts
under cover of a cold. So I instantly take myself in
hand whenever I begin to sneeze and to have chilly sensations
or a catch in the throat. The result has been
that since I was thirty I have not spent a cent on doctors
or lost a day through illness, and I&#8217;ve eaten and drunk
about as I pleased. I can see gentle reader&#8217;s expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
of disdain at these confessions as to my care for health.
You are welcome to your disdain, gentle reader. It is
characteristic of your shallowness. You see, the chief
difference between you and me is that I have imagination
while you have not. And as I have imagination, illness
makes to my mind a picture of revolting internal conditions
which I can no more endure than I could endure
having my outside unclean and frowzy.</p>

<p>Margot, coming by a later train, sent me word that
she was ill. She had called in a doctor. He poured
some medicine&mdash;some poison&mdash;into her, of course, and
so got her into the way of giving him an excuse for
robbing her. In England doctors rank socially with
butchers and bakers, rank scientifically with voodoo
quacks and astrologers. They still look on a cold as a
trifle, and treat it by feeding! The food and drugs she
swallowed soon reduced Margot to the state where it was
taking all the reserve force of her youth to save her from
severe illness. I was entirely well the following day, and
went to see her. The doctor&mdash;five guineas or twenty-five
dollars a visit&mdash;was coming twice a day; his assistant&mdash;two
guineas or ten dollars a visit&mdash;was coming four
times a day. The Marchioness of Crossley, a rich American,
was ill. Her social position and Dr. Sir Spratt
Wallet&#8217;s rank as a practitioner together made it imperative
that the illness be no ordinary affair. The second
day he issued bulletins to the papers. I attempted
to interfere in the treatment, but Margot would not
have it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s growing worse instead of better,&#8221; said I to
Wallet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;Certainly, sir,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;That is the regular
course with a cold.&#8221; And he stroked his whiskers and
looked at me with dull, self-complacent, supercilious eyes.
&#8220;The regular course, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In England, but not in America,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; said he, with heavy politeness. Then,
after a heavy pause, &#8220;her ladyship will be quite fit
again in a week&mdash;quite fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she was eating three strapping meals a day and
taking rhinitis and another equally poisonous drug I had
my doubts. But once you let a doctor in you are powerless.
If you order him out without giving him an opportunity
in his own good time to cure the mischief he
has done the consequences may be serious. Not to linger
over this incident in high life, Wallet made out of that
cold a hundred guineas, not counting his commissions
on the fees of his assistant, on the wages of a trained
nurse, and on the stuff from the chemist. If Margot had
been English born the bill would have been about one
fourth that sum&mdash;for the same rank in society. Slay
the Midianite! But that&#8217;s the rule the world over.
When I am &#8220;trimmed&#8221; abroad I console myself with
reflecting on the fate of the luckless foreigner visiting
America. Europe trims us to the quick; but we trim
to the bone; and when no foreigners are handy we keep
in practice by trimming one another.</p>

<p>Margot&#8217;s illness did not interfere with my efforts
to right her matrimonial ship and set it in its course
again. I had greatly modified my original plan. It
involved my seeking the Marquis. My new plan was
to compel him to seek me. I proceeded so successfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
that on the morning of the third day of Margot&#8217;s
&#8220;indisposition,&#8221; while I was at breakfast in
my sitting room, Markham came in with a grin of
triumph on his face. &#8220;You win,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;But you
always do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dawkins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s his card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him up. No&mdash;wait.... Tell him I&#8217;ll see him
in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gentle reader, you are about to learn why in that
controversy over settlements <i>I</i> abruptly abandoned the
struggle and yielded everything. I worked with Markham
at my mail and telegrams for three quarters of an
hour before I let Dawkins in. I saw at a glance that my
treatment of him had produced the effect I had hoped.
He was a typical middle-class Englishman&mdash;but all middle-class
Englishmen are typical. He was fattish and
baldish and smug. He had a beef-and-beer face, ruddy
and smooth except tufts of red-gray, curling whiskers
before either ear. He had cold, shrewd, pious eyes&mdash;the
eyes of the hypocrite who serves the Lord with every
breath he draws, and gets a blessing upon every crime he
commits before committing it. In my first interviews
with him I, being new to England, had made the mistake
of treating him as an equal, that is, as a human being.
My respect for myself forbids me to meet any of my
fellow-members of the human race in any other fashion.
But experience has taught me that in doing business with
a man, it is being absolutely necessary that you dominate
him unless you are willing to have him dominate you, the
most skillful care must be taken to impress him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
your superiority. A certain amount of &#8220;side&#8221; is useful
in America. A lot of it is imperative in England;
and if you are dealing with an Englishman who feels
that he is low, you dare not treat him as an equal or he
at once imagines you are lower than he, and despicable&mdash;and
you can do nothing with him.</p>

<p>I had suffered, and so had my lawyer, Norman, for
our American way of treating Dawkins. I appreciated
my mistake afterwards, and resolved not to repeat it.
I studied the manner of Crossley and Blankenship and
the other upper-class men toward the middle and lower
classes, and I learned to copy it, an accomplishment of
which I am not proud, though common sense forbids me
to be ashamed of it. Dawkins, entering with heels thoroughly
cooled, made ready to put out his hand, but did
so hesitatingly. He saw that his worst fears were realized,
altered the handshaking gesture into a tug at his
right whiskers. Nor did I offer him a seat, but simply
looked at him pleasantly over the top of my newspaper
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Dawkins, is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Loring. Hope you are well,
sir,&#8221; said Dawkins, now squeezing awkwardly into his
proper place.</p>

<p>I half turned my back on him and dictated a note
and a telegram to Markham. Then I glanced at Dawkins
again. &#8220;Ah, Dawkins, yes&mdash;what were you saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would esteem it a favor, sir, if you would give
me a few minutes of your time&mdash;alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are alone,&#8221; said I. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>The solicitor shifted his portly frame uneasily,
smoothed his top hat with his gloved left hand, glanced
dubiously at Markham. &#8220;The matter is confidential,
sir&mdash;relating to&mdash;to the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Markham knows more about my affairs than
I do,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t beat about the bush, Dawkins.
I have no time to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. I beg your pardon. It concerns
those bonds&mdash;the bonds you turned over to me in arranging
the settlements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I remember. Great Lakes and Gulf bonds,
were they not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely, sir. You bound us to a stipulation
that they were not to be converted for at least five
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said I. &#8220;In fact, I made it impossible
for you to convert them.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pained expression came into the face of Dawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I conceded everything else your client demanded,&#8221;
pursued I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it now develops, sir,&#8221; said Dawkins, &#8220;that that
was the only important thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have doubtless seen the papers these last few
days&mdash;the stock market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Yes&mdash;so the bonds <i>are</i> dropping. That&#8217;s
unfortunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dropping rapidly,&#8221; said Dawkins. &#8220;And there
are rumors that Great Lakes and Gulf will soon be practically
worthless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve read.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to ask you to release us. We wish to
sell. We must sell. If we don&#8217;t the settlement on your
son-in-law will be worthless.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled agreeably. &#8220;As worthless as his promises
to my daughter. As worthless as he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dawkins was breathing heavily. His pious eyes were
snapping with rage. He had prided himself on his
astuteness. He had gloated over his shrewdness in outwitting
Norman and me. And now he discovered that
the boot was on the other leg. I had trapped him and
put him and his client in my power.</p>

<p>I leaned back comfortably and smiled. &#8220;Of course
I know nothing about it, Dawkins, but I am willing to
make a Yankee guess that the bonds will continue to
drop until&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>When my pause became unendurable, he said: &#8220;Yes,
sir. Until when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until I discover some signs of value in my son-in-law.
Then he may discover some signs of value in
the bonds. Our America is a peculiar country, Dawkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peculiar will do, sir,&#8221; said he with respectful
insolence. &#8220;But I should have chosen another
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head laughingly. &#8220;What bad losers you
English are!&#8221; said I. &#8220;But&mdash;I&#8217;ll not detain you.
Good morning, Dawkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am to understand, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had my back squarely to him and was busy
with Markham, who took his cue for the little comedy
we were playing like the well-trained American business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
man that he was. Presently Markham said, &#8220;He&#8217;s
gone, and I never saw a madder man get out of a room
more awkwardly.&#8221;</p>

<p>You, gentle reader, who know about as much of the
science of managing men in practical life as you know
of any other phase of the world-that-is&mdash;you, gentle
reader, are shocked by my rudeness to a polite, well-educated,
well-dressed Englishman. And you hope&mdash;and
feel&mdash;that I overreached myself. But let me inform
you&mdash;not for your instruction but for my own satisfaction&mdash;courtesy
has to be used most sparingly. Human
vanity is so monstrous that men eagerly read into politeness
to them&mdash;the most ordinary politeness&mdash;evidence
that their superiority is inspiring fear, awe and desire
to conciliate them. You often hear men in high place
severely criticised for being rude, short, arrogant, insulting.
Do not condemn them too hastily. It may
be that they were driven into this attitude toward their
fellows by the disastrous consequences of courtesy. Be
polite to a man and he will misunderstand. Be cool to
him and he, thickly enveloped in his own good opinion
of himself, will not feel it. Rudeness, overt and unmistakable,
is often the one way to reach him and save not
only yourself but also him from the consequences of his
vanity. It is the instinct of big men to be big and
simple and natural in their dealings with their fellows.
The mass of little men with big vanities compels them
to suppress this instinct; and by suppression it inevitably
becomes in time crushed out of existence. How
can one who is busy continue to show consideration for
others if they, instead of showing a return consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
for him, take it as tribute to their importance and begin
to rear and impose and trample?</p>

<p>To cite my own relatively unimportant case, I have
long had a reputation for coldness and meager civility
in my business relations. I recall distinctly the desperate
pressure of sheer imposition that led me to
abandon my early openness to all comers at all times.
And I admit that I did change; rather abruptly, too,
for it suddenly came to me why I was slipping backwards.
But looking only at my career <i>since</i> the change,
when I think of the boredom I have endured, the folly
I have permitted to waste my valuable time&mdash;when I
recall the forbearance I have shown in sparing impudent
and lazy incompetence where I might, yes, ought
to have used the ax&mdash;when I think of my good-natured
tolerance in face of extremest daily provocation, year
after year, I marvel at myself and feel how unjust, how
characteristically the verdict of little shallow men, is
the attack on me as cold and unsympathetic. When
I consider how the leaders of the human race have been
tempted to tyranny, I cannot understand why history
is able to record comparatively few real tyrants, most
of them being homicidal lunatics like Nero, or success-crazed
megalomaniacs like Napoleon, and almost none
men of sanity. If the great of earth were as vain,
as selfishly, as egotistically inconsiderate of the small
as the small are of the great and of each other, would
not the story of history have come to an end long ago
for lack of surviving characters?</p>

<p>Two days after Dawkins came Crossley. I knew
that in America there is no one so easily frightened as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
a rich man who has inherited his wealth and does not
know whether, if he lost it, he could make a living or
not. All rich men are cowards, but that species is
craven. I suspected that the same thing was true of
the European type&mdash;the nobleman with the grotesque
pose of disdain for money that convinces and captivates
you, gentle reader, and your favorite authors. Crossley&#8217;s
face instantly showed me that my suspicion was
correct. He had been dissipating wildly for several
weeks, but it did not account for the look in his eyes.
If, gentle reader, you wish to learn the truth about the
aristocracy you worship&mdash;which you do not&mdash;get an
aristocrat where you can cut off or turn on his supply
of cash at will. You will then discover that he who has
a stiff neck also has supple knees&mdash;the stiffer the neck
the suppler the knees.</p>

<p>Crossley was a clever chap in his way; that is, he
knew his business of idle spender of unearned money
thoroughly. Another mode of putting it would be the
commonplace and less exact if more alluring phrase
&#8220;aristocrat to his finger tips.&#8221; There are many modes
of cringing. He showed judgment and taste&mdash;judgment
of me, taste in sparing himself&mdash;in his choice of the
mode. With fright and wariness in his eyes&mdash;the look
of readiness to go to any depths of self-abasement in
gaining his end&mdash;he put a tone of manly, bluff, shamefaced
contrition into his voice as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon my breaking in on you this way. I&#8217;ve
just heard. Is <i>she</i> very ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>He meant he had just heard about the bonds. I
knew he meant that, and he knew I knew it. But we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
were men of the world. &#8220;Not desperately ill,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Only about twenty guineas a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled a faint but flattering appreciation of my
humor, then resumed his gloomy anxiety and self-reproach.
&#8220;But she <i>is</i> ill. I read it in one of those
screaming ha&#8217;penny rags and came as fast as ever I
could. The truth is&mdash;well, we&#8217;ve had a bit of a row.
Has she told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; said I. &#8220;A little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve acted the skunk, the howling skunk&mdash;and I
want to&mdash; Do you think she&#8217;ll see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish, I&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be no end grateful,&#8221; said he with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>She saw him as soon as she could make herself presentable&mdash;and
her delay gave him a chance to tone up
his nerves and to smooth out his face. That afternoon
I was able to telegraph Edna that all was well
The Crossleys were reconciled; Love had scored another
of his famous triumphs. She came over the
following day, but I had sailed for America a few hours
before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day after my arrival in New York I saw Mary
Kirkwood and Hartley Beechman lunching together at
Delmonico&#8217;s. In those days that meant an engagement
actual or impending&mdash;or, at least, a flirtation far advanced
into the stage of loverlike intimacy. I was in
the passageway looking through the glass and the screen
of palms. I stood there long, noting every detail of
her. She was well, perfectly well&mdash;of that much her
eyes and her color assured me. Is there anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
lovelier than a clear dark skin, tastefully set off by
black-brown hair? Was she happy? I could not tell.
Still in her face was that restless, expectant look&mdash;not
unlike the expression of a child being shown a picture
book and too impatient for the next page rightly to
examine the one that is open. An intense interest in
life, an intense vitality&mdash;that fascinating capacity to
love, if she found the right man. And her beauty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Beauty she undoubtedly had. But charm does not
lie in beauty&mdash;physical charm, I mean. There is a
certain light in the eyes, a certain curve of cheek and
throat, of bosom and arm&mdash;and the blood flames and
rushes. She had charm for me. Her beauty impressed
others; it was her charm that made her the one woman
to me.</p>

<p>Blankenship came to take me into the caf&eacute; where
we were to lunch. I went with the meager consolation
that while I had stood there she had given Beechman
not a single glance with any suggestion of a feeling it
would have wounded me to the quick to see. Should I
speak to her? Did I dare risk the attempt? Would not
speaking to her be merely a useless torment? After
a long struggle that could have but one end, I said:
&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; rose and went to the palm room. They
were gone; the waiter was clearing the table at which
they had been sitting. I stared round dazedly, returned
to Blankenship.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not up to the mark&mdash;what?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;New York doesn&#8217;t agree with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate towns. They give you such dirty second-hand
stuff to breathe. Let&#8217;s move on&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>But it seemed there was no place on earth for me.
Don&#8217;t judge me so poorly as to think, or to imagine I
thought, this was due wholly to Mary Kirkwood. I
wish to be carefully, exactly accurate in this frank
recital of a man&#8217;s point of view. She was responsible
for my forlorn state to the extent that loving her had
revealed to me the futility and failure of my own life
and had made me see another sort of life that would
have been possible with her, that was impossible without
her&mdash;without love and comradeship. But loving her
did not make my life empty; it was already empty,
though I had not realized it. I understood now why
the big business men, as soon as they reached security,
cast about for some real interest. Most of them&mdash;nearly
all&mdash;were as unfortunate in their family relations
as I. They had trivial wives and trivial children&mdash;mere
silly strutters and spenders. They sought interest
in art, in science, in religion, in exploration, in
philanthropy, in politics, in stamps and butterflies, in
old books and antiques, in racing stables and prize fighting,
in gambling, in drink, in women. Their craving
was now mine. How to find an interest that would make
life attractive to me, with Mary Kirkwood left out&mdash;there
was my problem.</p>

<p>While waiting for the solution, I followed Blankenship
to the Northwest. The second day from New
York, as he and I were walking up and down the platform
during a halt&mdash;at St. Paul, I think it was&mdash;Hartley
Beechman joined us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I see you in the caf&eacute; at Delmonico&#8217;s a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
days ago?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I was getting my hat and stick
in a rush. It certainly looked like your back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; said I. And I was seized with a wild
longing to escape from him and a wilder longing to
hold on to him and to pour out question after question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Kirkwood and I were lunching together,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;We talked of you. I told her I thought
I had seen you, and she said she heard you were in
town and was much hurt because you hadn&#8217;t looked
her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was merely passing through,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has an enormous admiration for you,&#8221; continued
he. &#8220;She says you have imagination&mdash;which
means that she thinks you in the small class. You
know the world divides into sheep and goats on imagination,
with the mass in the have-not class. I believe it&#8217;s
the true distinction between House of Have and House
of Have-not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is well?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always. She knows how to take care of herself.
I never knew a woman so sensible&mdash;and sensible means
the reverse of what it&#8217;s usually supposed to mean when
applied to a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>This hardly sounded like an engaged man talking
of his fianc&eacute;e. On the other hand, Beechman was a
peculiar chap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she still live in the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now&mdash;yes. Last winter she kept house for
Bob in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>But you will not be interested in how I drew from
him bit by bit a hundred details of her life, stories of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
what she had said and done. I saw Beechman several
hours every day until he left us at Seattle. Alternately
I thought him merely her closest man friend and her
accepted lover. At times I thought he was not quite
sure, himself, in which position he stood. When we were
having our last talk together I nerved myself and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard in London that she was to be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt him drawing in and shutting all doors and
windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have <i>you</i> heard anything of it?&#8221; pursued I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, in the case of a woman like her,&#8221; replied he,
&#8220;there&#8217;s always gossip about this man and that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ought to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She <i>will</i> marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>I forced a smile, and, as we knew each other so
well, I ventured: &#8220;You speak as one having authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>you</i> know she will?&#8221; parried he.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like evasion,&#8221; laughed I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. She cannot escape. Some man will
convince her&mdash;surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But so far as you know, no man has?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were frankly mocking. &#8220;I did not say
that,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And I could get no further.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before I returned to New York in the autumn I
had added a lot of far western enterprises to my already
long list of occupations. Everything I touched
seemed to succeed. Even my new secretary, Rossiter,
proved better than Markham. Markham had an indifferent
memory and a fondness for women that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
trying. Rossiter forgot nothing and was as shy of
the women, including the ladies, as was Lord Blankenship,
who yawned and retreated at the very sight of a
skirt. The news from England was altogether satisfactory.
An heir was hoped for, and Crossley had become
a devoted husband and was about to enter politics.
This struck me as a huge joke, the more so because I
knew that in England Crossley would be welcomed as
a source of real strength to his party. It seemed to
me amazing how England could stagger along when
she was being managed by such men and was grateful
for it. But when I spoke to Blankenship about it, he set
me to thinking from a different standpoint.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son-in-law is going into politics,&#8221; said I. &#8220;In
America he couldn&#8217;t be elected dog-catcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I fancy money will do most anything most
anywhere,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The news from Paris was equally good. Edna had
settled there after a joyous summer going from country
house to country house in Britain, and from ch&acirc;teau
to ch&acirc;teau in France. She had seen one ch&acirc;teau
which she wished me to buy, and she begged me to come
over and inspect it. She did not explicitly say so, but
I read between the lines that she was greatly strengthening
her social position by giving out that she purposed
buying a big place. You may imagine how much
enthusiasm for her such an announcement would create
among noble down-at-the-heel families eager to exchange
unsalable old rook-roosts for American dollars.
I could hear her talking&mdash;how subtly she would put
forth the suggestion, how diplomatically she would discuss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
each worthless stone heap in turn&mdash;and how she
would rake in the invitations so difficult to get unless
one happens to know how, and so easy when one does
know.</p>

<p>But with my arrival in New York I had a reverse.
A cable came from Edna saying that she was sailing
at once and wished to see me.</p>

<p>I could not imagine what she wanted, and I did not
waste much time in making guesses. One evening, when
Armitage and I were dining together in the Federal Club&mdash;Blankenship
had sailed for home&mdash;the idea flashed
into my mind that perhaps Edna wanted a divorce.
Immediately I felt that I had hit upon the precise reason
for her coming. You will have no difficulty in imagining
what was the next idea in my train of thought.
If she divorced me I should be free to marry whom I
pleased!</p>

<p>It was stupid of me, but in all my revolvings of my
hopeless love for Mary Kirkwood never once had I
thought of divorcing my wife. I cannot account for
this lapse, except as an instance of the universal human
failing for overlooking the obvious. There was no religious
scruple in my early training to make me shy
of divorce. On the contrary, my parents, like most
old-fashioned Americans of faiths other than Episcopal
and Catholic&mdash;and Episcopalians and Catholics
were few in the old American stock, except in New York
and Baltimore and South Carolina&mdash;most old-fashioned
Americans believed that living together in wedlock
without love was sin, that divorce was no mere
necessary evil, but a religious rite as sacred as marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
itself. A house, they held, is either a House of
Hate or a House of Love, and no one should remain in
a House of Hate, and no child should be brought up
there.</p>

<p>No doubt, if Edna and I had been living under the
same roof the idea of divorce would have taken form,
actively definite form, long before. But we had no
home to be a House of Hate. We did not hate each
other; we bored each other. And as we were not poor,
we lived far enough apart not to annoy each other in
the least. I cheerfully paid any ransom she exacted
for leaving me free&mdash;and you may be sure she was not
inexpensive. She had her own fortune&mdash;and it gave
her quite an income&mdash;but she husbanded that. She insisted
upon state and equipage, not to mention such
small matters as stockings at fifty dollars a pair and
chemises at three hundred dollars apiece&mdash;for, she
knew how lovely she was and demanded for her beautiful
body the most beautiful garments that could be devised
by French ingenuity at combining cost and simplicity.
I was&mdash;by instinct rather than by avowed
principles&mdash;thoroughly old-fashioned in my family
ideas. Indeed, I still am; and I say this with no apology.
It may be that woman will some day develop another
and higher sphere for herself. But first she
would do well&mdash;in my humbly heretical opinion&mdash;to
learn to fill the sphere she now rattles round in like
one dry pea in a ten-gallon can. I want to see a few
more women up to the modern requirements for wife
and mother. I want to see a few more women making
a living without using their sex charms&mdash;a few less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
&#8217;tending the typewriter with one eye while the other and
busier is on the lookout for a husband. I believe in
emancipation of women&mdash;in votes for women&mdash;in all that
sort of thing. The one and only way to learn to swim
is in the water. I am sick and tired of woman the
irresponsible, woman the cozener and milker of man,
woman the dead weight upon man, and drawing the
pay of a housewife and shirking all a housewife&#8217;s
duties. So, you see, I am the friend of woman&mdash;not
of woman&#8217;s vanity and laziness and passion for parasiteism,
but of woman&#8217;s education and self-respect and
independence.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly old-fashioned. My notion of wife
was the independent, self-respecting equal of her husband.
That is, I had the typical American husband&#8217;s
ideal&mdash;the ideal that dates from the pioneer days of
no property and of labor for all, the ideal the American
man still lives up to, the one that enables woman
to betray him. And, having this ideal, I never permitted
myself&mdash;no, not even when I spoke to her the contrary
in words&mdash;I never permitted myself to <i>feel</i> that my
wife was not in the main what she should be.</p>

<p>If you have borne me company thus far, gentle
reader, turn away now. For, dreadful things are coming.
I said to Armitage: &#8220;Your sister&mdash;she&#8217;s still in
the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s abroad,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;She&#8217;s visiting
friends in Budapest. Later on she&#8217;s to yacht in the
East Mediterranean&mdash;she and the Horace Armstrongs
and Beechman&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; He gave several names I do
not now recall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>&#8220;Is she engaged to Beechman?&#8221; I asked carelessly,
but the question was not one that could sound other
than raw.</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;an expression I did not like. At first
I thought it a rebuke to my impertinence. Afterwards
I saw no such notion was in his mind. &#8220;Beechman?
Good Lord, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are <i>sure</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolute. He&#8217;d not dare go in that direction with
<i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;you see&mdash; She doesn&#8217;t care for him,&#8221;
replied Armitage lamely. I was not liking him so well,
now that I knew the world&mdash;his world&mdash;better and could
judge its beliefs and its hypocrisies more accurately.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an unusual man,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She might easily
care for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted he irritably. &#8220;I happen
to know she doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was convinced. Armitage&#8217;s tone said in effect that
he had heard the rumor, had questioned her, had been
assured that there was no basis for it.</p>

<p>So, she was abroad&mdash;five or six days away. I could
not go to her and make a beginning. Would I have
gone if she had been within reach? I do not know. I
rather think not. As I have said, I was old-fashioned;
and the sort of love I felt for her, and my sense of what
she had suffered at the hands of the first man she had
trusted would have made me wait, I hope, until I was
free. Still, love is insidiously compelling. Who can say
what love would or would not beguile or goad him into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
doing? The old-fashioned man, always reminding himself
that women haven&#8217;t an equal chance with men, was
inclined to be considerate in his dealings with a woman.
The new-fashioned man lets her look out for herself. I
am not sure that he is wrong. Perhaps some who have
read thus far will guess the reason for my doubt.</p>

<p>You may imagine how impatiently I waited for Edna
to arrive. I am afraid Rossiter found me difficult in
those intervening days. Only the weak sort of men and
women are easy for an intelligent person to live with.
Men and women of positive character have their impossible
moods. I made this remark to Mary Kirkwood on
that yachting trip in the Sound. And her quick answer
was: &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true. But everything worth while is
difficult. Weathering the stormy days would have its
compensations&mdash;and more.&#8221; What a woman! No wonder
I loved her.</p>

<p>When Edna finally arrived&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What an arrival it was! She was attended by two
maids, one French, the other Italian. She had trained
them&mdash;she and their former fashionable mistresses&mdash;to
treat her as if she was a royal person, requiring the most
minute assistance, incapable even of ascertaining for
herself whether it was daylight or dark, rain or shine.
She was clad in the latest Paris fashions, adapted and
improved for her own especial charms. She wore much
jewelry, but nothing noisy. There never was anything
noisy about her&mdash;any more than there is about a burst
of sunshine that fills and floods the whole place, permeating
everywhere and dominating everything. She
talked by turns in English&mdash;with a superb British accent&mdash;in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
French that sounded Parisian and in Italian that
seemed as liquid and swift as the Italian maid&#8217;s. It was
a vast ship, and there were about a thousand passengers,
and much luggage. To me, to all on the pier that day,
there seemed to be but one landing and but one lot of
luggage.</p>

<p>How many trunks had she? Heaven only knows.
The customs people were glad to expedite her after a
glance at the exhibit imposing both in extent and in
costliness. She affected a delightful, most aristocratic
unconsciousness of the stir she was making, of the excited
admiration of men, of the gaping or jeering envy
of women. Yes, it was a great day, and as I accompanied
her in the auto to the Plaza, I felt dowdy and
insignificant&mdash;felt like a humble male menial, a courier
or valet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not fully appreciate your magnificence,&#8221; said
I, &#8220;until I saw you on these humble shores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is shocking here&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said she. &#8220;So incomplete,
so crude. No wonder the ideals are low. The
surroundings give no inspiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None&mdash;except for work,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It&#8217;s a land
for working people only. No doubt you&#8217;ll be going back
soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I can,&#8221; replied she. With a friendly
but not tender smile: &#8220;As soon as you&#8217;ll let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The absence of her customary effusiveness confirmed
my theory of her coming. I had thought all out with
the utmost care. I felt it would be in every way unwise
to let her see that I was eager for the divorce. She
must open the subject. It had ever been my rule, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
I wanted anything, so to maneuver that the other person
should propose the exchange. It is the rule of successful
operation in every department of life. Therefore,
adhering strictly to my prearranged programme,
I could only sit tight and wait.</p>

<p>How she tried my patience! I was mad to have the
preliminaries over, to have the divorce under way&mdash;mad,
not with the hysterical impatience of those short-sighted
people who mess their purposes through lack of self-restraint,
but with the white-hot repressed patience of
those who have their way in this world. Day followed
day, and she did not speak. I gave up the evenings
and a large part of the afternoons to her. I stayed on
after dinner until there was no further excuse for lingering.
I listened to her interminable recital of fashionable
names, dates, gossip, adventure. A week of this, and
just as my fortitude was wearing itself out and I had
begun to debate opening the subject myself, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been down looking at our house. Really it&#8217;s
not half bad. Why shouldn&#8217;t we open it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not know what to say. Was I mistaken in her
purpose in coming? Or was this proposal to open the
house the clever move of a clever gamester to force me
to speak first?</p>

<p>&#8220;This lovely weather!&#8221; she went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame
such a climate should be wasted upon such a vulgar city.
When I think of the dreadful rains that infest Paris and
the rains and fogs of London&mdash; How they would glory
in this sun and sparkling air.&#8221;</p>

<p>To my notion New York was vastly more attractive
than dreary London or rainy, sloppy Paris. But I made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
no defense of New York. I wished her to think it crude
and tiresome.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the fashionable society here,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;What a silly copy of the real thing over there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must remind you of Passaic,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She visibly shivered.</p>

<p>I was suddenly seized of a base inspiration. In my
despair I did not hesitate. Said I: &#8220;That reminds me.
We must go over to see the old people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;m so neglectful.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt&mdash;I saw&mdash;that I was on the right track at last.
&#8220;When will you go?&#8221; I persisted. &#8220;Next Sunday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said she faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll go Sunday. They fret because you never
write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In splendid health. There&#8217;s no reason why all four
of them shouldn&#8217;t outlive us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you go often?&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been for some time,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You see,
I&#8217;ve been away.... If we opened the house, we could
have them visit us. That would make up to them for
the way we&#8217;ve acted.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed at me in large-eyed horror. Suddenly she
smiled with patient scorn and shrugged her shoulders.
&#8220;Oh, I had forgotten your passion for jesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in earnest,&#8221; said I&mdash;and I was indeed in the
full flood of a virtuous penitence whose hypocrisy I did
not detect until I was thinking about the matter afterwards.
You, gentle reader, would in the same circumstances
never have permitted yourself to discover the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
hypocrisy. I went on: &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of the way I&#8217;ve
acted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got everything they need or want,&#8221; said
Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Material comfort,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;But haven&#8217;t
parents a right to expect something more? And now
that our social position is secure, we&#8217;ve no excuse for
acting snobbishly.&#8221;</p>

<p>I enjoyed this virtuous talk for itself; still more, I
enjoyed teasing her. Her delicate, refined, ladylike
nerves were aristocratically sensitive. Have you observed
that peculiarity of lady nerves? A lady will live
with the most shocking husband for luxury. She will
endure the most degrading humiliations to get dresses,
jewels, motor cars. She will crawl in the dirt to gain
or to improve social position. She will, without a quiver,
kiss her worst enemy, cut her dearest friends, in the
furtherance of any ladylike purpose. But talk to her
of self-respecting independence, of earning her own living,
or of any of the homely decencies of life&mdash;of her
ignorant old parents or unsightly poor relatives&mdash;and
what a fairy princess of high-strung nerves she straightway
becomes. Yes, Edna was a lady&mdash;a perfect lady,
as perfect as if she had been born to it.</p>

<p>To my surprise I had daunted her only for the day;
the following afternoon she began again. &#8220;This heavenly
weather!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;It tempts me to stay
on and on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will last over Sunday,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She ignored the shaft, and went on with undiminished
enthusiasm: &#8220;And really New York has improved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
In some respects it can be compared to Paris&mdash;though,
of course, it has no background. A city can be built in
a generation or so. But to build up the country&mdash;that
takes centuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s building up rapidly,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be astonished
Sunday by the change down where the old folks
are. The Fosdicks have bought up twenty farms or so,
and are making a park. I saw Amy Siersdorf not long
ago and she spoke of having stopped at father&#8217;s place
and got milk and corn bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fluffy little cat,&#8221; said Edna, not especially
ruffled. &#8220;I shall snub her the first time we meet. But
I was about to speak of our house. I am arranging to
open it. Of course, Margot can&#8217;t come over <i>this</i> winter,
but I don&#8217;t really need her. We owe it to our friends
here to do something socially. I want to stop the gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gossip?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The talk because we are not living together. It
isn&#8217;t dangerous, but it&#8217;s uncomfortable. I believe people
like us ought to maintain the best social traditions&mdash;ought
to set a good example to the lower classes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; said I as good-humoredly as I could.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll do as we please. Otherwise, where&#8217;s the use in
having money?&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause which I felt was hopeful. Edna said with
affected carelessness: &#8220;<i>You</i> don&#8217;t think people have a
right to&mdash;to divorce?&#8221;</p>

<p>At last! My intuition had been correct! &#8220;Why
not?&#8221; replied I, my tone as casual as hers. &#8220;Certainly,
if they wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence. Then she: &#8220;Sometimes I feel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
way myself. When two people find that they&#8217;re uncongenial,
that they&#8217;d be better off&mdash;happier&mdash;if free to go
their separate ways and to realize to the full their own
ideals of life&mdash; Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely my view,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Again a long silence. She finally said: &#8220;Has it ever
occurred to you, Godfrey, that you and I might be better
off&mdash;apart?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good many years now since we
were together,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;We might as well be divorced
as living the way we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been feeling those very things,
that I&#8217;ve come back,&#8221; said she. &#8220;It seemed to me that,
now I&#8217;ve fulfilled my duty to Margot, I ought to do my
duty to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;For you life is one
long sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she scented irony she dissembled well. &#8220;Sacrifice
is the woman&#8217;s part,&#8221; replied she sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;you&#8217;re willing to stay here
where you&#8217;re unhappy, and for my sake to jam the
house night after night with people you care nothing
about, and disport yourself in splendor to make the
world envy me. I appreciate your nobility of character,
but I positively can&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must do our duty,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Society expects
certain things of us, and we must do them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I, my dear. Open the house if you like. But
I stick to my bachelor apartment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to go back to Europe?&#8221; said she
with a fine show of quiet melancholy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>&#8220;I want you to do as you please,&#8221; was my answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But unless I stay here, and you and I take our
place in society together, I&mdash;&#8221; She hesitated. &#8220;Now
that Margot is settled,&#8221; she went on desperately, &#8220;I am
adrift. And&mdash;Godfrey, we <i>can&#8217;t</i> go on as we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that,&#8221; said I. &#8220;What do you propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To stay in New York,&#8221; replied she, with the
promptness of the skilled fencer. &#8220;To stay here and
be the mistress of your establishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My establishment is an apartment at Sherry&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; remonstrated she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be calm, my dear. I don&#8217;t ask you to lead my
kind of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;what do you propose?&#8221; ventured she.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and settled myself more
comfortably in her luxurious motor. I gazed with absorbed
interest at the bunch of orchids in the flower-holder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we can continue neither free nor
bound,&#8221; pursued she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever you like,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Only&mdash;no fashionable
capering for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to get a divorce, Godfrey?&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to be happy,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Divorce has
no terrors for me. Aren&#8217;t we practically divorced
already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said she. &#8220;We never did have much
in common.&#8221; Then she reddened&mdash;for, she could not
quite forget those first days of our married life, before I
got the money to feed her ambition. &#8220;You make me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
feel as if you were a&mdash;no, not a stranger, but only a
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we <i>are</i> friends,&#8221; said I heartily. &#8220;And always
shall be.&#8221; For I was beginning to like her, to take
the amiably indifferent outsider&#8217;s view of her, now that
she was freeing me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey, do you want to marry again?&#8221; she asked
with a sudden shrewd look straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>I laughed easily. &#8220;That question might better
come from me,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You will never be happy, I
suppose, until you are the Duchess or Princess Something-or-other.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush stole over her small sweet face, making it
lovelier than ever. &#8220;I never thought of such a thing,&#8221;
she protested&mdash;but too energetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;ve dreamed it for years.
Be honest with me, Edna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I dream it?&#8221; replied she. &#8220;It would
take an awful lot of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have quite a bunch,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And if we
parted, naturally I&#8217;d give you more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again&mdash;but this time slowly&mdash;the searching
gaze turned upon me.</p>

<p>I bore it well. &#8220;You can&#8217;t live as I live,&#8221; I went on.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t live as you live. You say that means divorce.
I don&#8217;t think so. Many rich American couples live
apart without divorce. I believe usually the reason is
the wife has found she couldn&#8217;t get a large enough slice
of the husband&#8217;s fortune, if she divorced him. Still, for
whatever reason, they stay married. You don&#8217;t like the
idea. So I say, if you want to go I&#8217;ll give you as much as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
I gave Margot&mdash;in addition to what you already have&mdash;and
my blessing. I&#8217;ve some sentiment about the past,
but it is as a past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;stunned,&#8221; said she. And I think her vanity
was.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what you want?&#8221; rejoined I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You put me in a hard position, Godfrey. You
give me no alternative but to accept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a hard man,&#8221; said I suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are really willing to let me go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You expected to have a difficult time persuading
me?&#8221; laughed I.</p>

<p>She looked at me reproachfully. &#8220;Do be serious,
Godfrey, about these serious things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. What do you say, Edna? Yes or
no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have time to think,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;This
is a very solemn moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why fake?&#8221; said I pleasantly. &#8220;You have it all
thought out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is solemn to <i>me</i>, Godfrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing solemn about our married life.
It&#8217;s a farce.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was searching for confirmation of her fear
of some kind of trap. &#8220;You really mean that you wish
to free me?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean precisely what I say,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Freedom
and the cash are yours for the asking. But you
must ask, my dear. I&#8217;ll not have any more of your
favorite comedy of making yourself out a martyr.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how you hurt me,&#8221; cried she.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
&#8220;But you always have hurt me&mdash;always. I know&mdash;&#8221;
very gently&mdash;&#8220;that you didn&#8217;t mean to, but you haven&#8217;t
understood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did my best,&#8221; said I, with the pleasant smile of
which she was so intolerant. &#8220;But what can be expected
of a plain, coarse materialist of a business man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you are generous in many ways,&#8221; mused she.
&#8220;It&#8217;s simply that you can&#8217;t understand me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s <i>you</i> that don&#8217;t understand <i>me</i>,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; inquired she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; I replied carelessly. How hope to
make a vain woman, obsessed of the notion that she has
a profound and mysterious soul when she simply has a
fog-bank&mdash;how hope to make her see the truth about
herself? &#8220;It isn&#8217;t worth explaining. Only&mdash;when you
are free and you find some one who appreciates and sympathizes
with that soul of yours, be careful to pay him
well, and to keep on paying. You can always be flattered
and fooled, if you pay for it. But if you don&#8217;t
pay&mdash; Look out. You may hear the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a cynic you are!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Thank God,
I haven&#8217;t your low views of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your views, by all means,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t forget my advice. You are lovely. You are
charming. You dress beautifully and have good taste.
But it&#8217;s the money, my dear, that causes the excitement
about those charms and graces. Hold on to
your principal, and spend your income freely but
judiciously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only convince you that there is something
beside money in the world.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>&#8220;Not for those to whom money is the breath of
life,&#8221; replied I.</p>

<p>When we returned to her hotel she urged me to come
in for tea. We went into the greenroom, to listen to
the music and to observe the crowds. There was a
sprinkling of men, but two thirds were women&mdash;women
of all classes and conditions, above the working class.
Women obviously fashionable as well as rich. Women
obviously only rich. Women living off men respectably.
Women &#8220;trimming&#8221; here and there. An army
of pretty women&mdash;well-cared-for bodies, attractive faces,
inviting the various kinds of sensual attack from the
subtlest to the frankest. This woman at the next table
is rather cheaply dressed, except a gorgeous hat. That
woman yonder has contrived to &#8220;trim&#8221; only a handsome
set of furs; it looks grotesque with the rest of the
costume. A third has a huge gilt bag as her sole claim
to sisterhood with the throng of fair pampered parasites
upon husbands, fathers, lovers. A charming and a useless
throng. No, not charming, unless a man happens
to be in the mood in which he succumbs to the trimming
process with pleasure&mdash;and then, he would not think
them altogether useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;New York grows more and more like Europe,&#8221;
said my wife, gazing around with shining eyes, and inhaling
the heavily scented atmosphere with dilating
nostrils. &#8220;More and more like Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More and more,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Especially the
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re ahead of the European women,&#8221; said
she.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;So they are,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Yes&mdash;they beat the European
women at it. But I&#8217;m not sure whether that&#8217;s
because they are really cleverer, or merely because our
men trim more readily.&#8221;</p>

<p>She regarded me with an expression of mildly interested
perplexity, as if she couldn&#8217;t imagine what was the
&#8220;it&#8221; I was talking about. &#8220;You must admit they are
lovely,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit it?&#8221; said I. &#8220;I proclaim it. If a man&#8217;s
notion of dinner is only the dessert, he couldn&#8217;t do
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked still more vague&mdash;one of her tricks when
she wished to avoid or to ignore. &#8220;I never touch desserts,&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>As I was leaving&mdash;for we were not dining together
that evening&mdash;she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall think about your proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked straight at her. &#8220;Tell me whether you will
or will not confirm your own proposal,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t delay too long. Unfinished business makes me
nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>She returned my look with quiet composure. &#8220;I
shall let you know to-morrow,&#8221; said she.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> my acquaintances, both in and out of fashionable
society, there were not a few jealous husbands.
I knew one man who, in the evening, made his wife account
for every moment of the day, and tell him in detail
how she was going to spend the following day, and
during business hours he called up irregularly on the
telephone. He was not content with the effective system
of espionage which a retinue of servants automatically
establishes. Another man&mdash;to give a typical instance
of each of the two types&mdash;hired detectives from
time to time to watch his wife living abroad &#8220;for her
health and to educate her children.&#8221; In a decently ordered
society this sort of jealousy is rare. Only where
the women are luxuriously supported parasites and the
men are attaching but the one value to the women&mdash;the
only value they possess for them&mdash;only there do you find
this defiling jealousy the rule instead of the exception.
Naturally, if the woman is mere property the man guards
her as he guards the rest of his material possessions; and
the woman who consents to be mere property probably
needs guarding if she has qualities of desirability discoverable
by other eyes than those of her overprizing
owner.</p>

<p>This jealousy was in the air of the offices and clubs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
I frequented. But it had somehow or other never infected
me. Was I occupied too deeply with other matters?
Was I indifferent? Did my own disinclination to
dalliance make me slow to appreciate the large part dalliance
now plays in American life? I do not know why
I was free from jealousy. I only know that never once
had my mind been shadowed by a sinister thought as to
what my wife might be about, far away and free. Possibly
my knowledge of her absorption in social ambition
kept me quiet. Certainly a woman whose whole mind
and heart are set upon social climbing is about the last
person a seeker for dalliance would invest.</p>

<p>I had never heard a word or a hint of a scandal about
her&mdash;for the best of reasons; she did nothing to cause
that kind of talk. But, how curious is coincidence! On
the very evening of the day of our divorce discussion
Edna had her first experience of scandal, and I immediately
knew of it. After leaving her I went to the Federal
Club, where I often took a hand in a rather stiff game of
bridge before dinner. I drifted into the reading room,
glanced idly at the long row of current magazines. In
full view lay the weekly purveyor of social news, a paper
I had not looked at half a dozen times in my life, and
then only because some one had asked me to read a particular
paragraph. The week&#8217;s issue of this scandal
monger had just come in. I threw back the cover, let my
glance drop upon the page. I was hardly aware that I
was reading&mdash;for my thoughts were elsewhere&mdash;when I
became vaguely conscious that the print had some relation
to me. I reread it; it was a veiled attack upon
Edna. All unsuspected by her husband&mdash;so the story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
ran&mdash;she had come to America to divorce him that she
might marry a German nobleman of almost royal rank.
A voice close beside me said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it amuses you so in that dirty sheet?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Armitage. I started guiltily. Then my
common sense asserted itself, and I pointed to the paragraph.
When he had read it I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the German? I&#8217;m not well enough up on
the nobility to be able to guess, though it&#8217;s probably
plainly told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count von Biestrich,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said I, no wiser than before, and we went
up to play bridge.</p>

<p>A year or so before I might possibly have talked
freely with Armitage; but the day of our closest intimacy
had passed. He was still my intimate friend; I was his&mdash;with
several large reservations. Why? Chiefly because
when he passed the critical age his mind took the
turn for the worse. At forty to forty-five a man begins
to reap his harvest. Armitage had many and varied
interests, but the one that affected his nature most profoundly
was women. He mocked at them; he was always
inventing or relating stories about them of the more or
less gamey sort. But, somewhat like his pretensions of
disdain for birth and fashion, his wordy scorn of women
concealed a slavish weakness for them. After forty this
began to disclose itself in his features. Their handsome
intellectuality began to be marred by a sensual heaviness;
and presently his wit degenerated toward a repellent
coarseness. It takes delicate juggling to make filth
attractive. After forty a man does well to be careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
how he attempts it; for, after forty, the hand loses its
lightness. I rather avoided Armitage; not that I was
squeamish, but my sense of humor somehow rarely has
responded to rude rootings and pawings in the garbage
barrel.</p>

<p>About an hour after dinner Edna called me to the
telephone and asked me to come to her. I found her in
high excitement, her color vivid, her manner nervous
beyond its natural vivacity even as now expanded upon
the best Continental models. &#8220;I got rid of my guests,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;and sent for you as soon as I could. Have
you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About von Biestrich?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hideous!&mdash;hideous!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I who have
kept my name unsullied&mdash;I who have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of that,&#8221; I interrupted. &#8220;I&#8217;m dead tired
and, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught me by the arm. &#8220;Godfrey, you think
this was what I had in mind. I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been all that a wife is expected to
be,&#8221; said I, in my usual manner of good-natured raillery.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m also sure you would wait until you
were free, and would deliberate very carefully before
deciding&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey, how can you!&#8221; cried she, in her most exaggerated
tone for outraged spirituality. &#8220;Have you
<i>no</i> heart? Have you no respect for me&mdash;your wife, the
mother of your daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not said I did not suspect you?&#8221; remonstrated
I. &#8220;Why so agitated, my dear? Do you wish
to make me begin to suspect?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>She shrank and began to cool down. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
had such an experience before,&#8221; she apologized. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know how to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing&mdash;nothing,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word of honor that if I were free
I should not consider marrying that German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you.&#8221; I put out a friendly hand. &#8220;Good
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This ends all talk of divorce,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>I dropped my hand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that the situation
is changed in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you are not a woman,&#8221; replied she.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t appreciate how I feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wished to be free before this paragraph appeared.
You still wish to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>how</i> can you be so insensible!&#8221; cried she, all
unstrung again and, I could not but see, genuinely so.
&#8220;I <i>never</i> could face the scandal of a divorce. I didn&#8217;t
realize. It would kill me. How <i>did</i> Hilda face it?&mdash;and
all these other nice women? I should hide and
never show my face again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was agitating me so wildly that I felt I could
not much longer conceal it. &#8220;I must go,&#8221; said I, pretending
to yawn. &#8220;Sleep on it. Perhaps to-morrow
you&#8217;ll feel differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to detain me, but I broke away and fled.
To be almost free and then to have freedom snatched
away! Not out of reach, but where it can be reached
easily if one will simply stretch out his hand somewhat
ruthlessly. By no means so ruthless as my wife had
been a score of times in gaining her ends without regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
to me. Why not be ruthless? Had she not been ruthless?
Had she not given me the right to compel her to
free me? More, did she not herself wish to be free?
And was she not now restrained, not by consideration for
me, not by any decent instinct whatsoever, but solely by
a snobbish groveling fear of public opinion?&mdash;a senseless
fear, too?</p>

<p>We are constantly criticising people&mdash;by way of
patting ourselves on the back&mdash;because they take what
they want regardless of the feelings of others. A form
of self-righteousness as shameless as common; for we
happen not to fancy the things they show themselves
inconsiderate and swinish about. But&mdash;when we really
do want a thing&mdash;what then? How industrious we become
in appeal to conscience&mdash;that most perfect of
courtiers&mdash;to show us how just and right it is that we
should have this thing <i>we</i> want! Having set myself
drastically to cure self-fooling years before&mdash;when first
I realized how dangerous it is and how common a cause
of failure and ruin&mdash;I was unable to conceal from myself
the cruelty of forcing Edna to divorce me. My conscience&mdash;as
sly a sophist and flatterer as yours, gentle
reader&mdash;my conscience could not convince me. Cruel
things I had never done&mdash;that is, not directly. Of
course I, like all men of action, had again and again been
compelled to do them indirectly. But not by my own direct
act had I ever made any human being suffer. I
would not begin now. I would not commit the stupidity
of trying to found my happiness upon the wretchedness
of another. I could feel the withering scorn that would
blaze in Mary Kirkwood&#8217;s honest eyes if I should go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
to her after having freed myself by force, and she
should find it out. I see your sarcastic smile, gentle
reader, as I thus ingenuously confess the selfish fear
that was the hidden spring of my virtue. Your smile
betrays your shallowness. If you knew human nature
you would know that all <i>real</i> motives are selfish. The
differences of character in human beings are not differences
between selfish and unselfish. They are differences
between petty, short-sighted selfishness and broad, far-sighted
selfishness.</p>

<p>When I saw Edna again she was still wavering. She
had come to America with her mind made up for divorce,
if I could by hook or by crook be induced to consent.
She had been frightened by this attack upon her&mdash;frightened
as only those who live a life of complete
self-deception can be frightened by a sudden and public
holding up of the mirror to reflect their naked selves.
She was, of course, easily able to convince herself that
her own motives in seeking a divorce were fine and
high and self-martyring. But she could now see no
way to convince others. In the public estimation she
saw she would be classed with Lady Blankenship,
with Mrs. Ramsdell, with all the other women who
had got divorces to better themselves socially or financially.</p>

<p>Instead of dying out the scandal grew. The daily
papers took up the hints in the society journal&#8217;s veiled
paragraph, had long cabled accounts of Count von
Biestrich, of his attentions to Edna, told when and
where they had been guests at the same ch&acirc;teaus and
country houses, made it appear that they had been no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
better than they should be for nearly a year. Edna
was prostrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one answer to these attacks,&#8221; she said
to me. &#8220;You must give up your apartment and move
to this hotel. We must open the house and live in it
together and entertain together.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was not unprepared. I had threshed out the whole
matter with myself, had made my choice between the two
courses open to me&mdash;or, rather, had forced myself to see
the truth that there was in decency but the one course.
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said I to her&mdash;and that was all.</p>

<p>I moved to the Plaza the same day; I was seen constantly
with her; I did my best to show the world that
all was serene between us. In fact, if you saw us
during those scandal-clouded days you may have thought
us a couple on a honeymoon. Behind the scenes we
quarreled&mdash;about anything, about everything, about
nothing&mdash;as people do when forced to play in public
the farce of billing and cooing lovers. Especially if
one of them has not the faintest glimmer of a sense of
humor. But in public&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The newspapers soon had to drop their campaign
of slander by insinuation.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that by the opening of the
season Edna and I were installed in the big house,
decidedly improved now thanks to the collecting both of
ideas and of things she had done abroad. And we were
giving all kinds of parties, with me taking part to an
extent I should have laughed at beforehand as impossible.
She had become so irritating to me that the
mere sight of her put me in a rage. Have you ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
been forced into intimate daily contact with a nature
that is thoroughly artificial&mdash;after you have discovered
its artificiality, its lack of sincerity, its vanity and pretense
and sex trickery? There is, as we all know, in
everyone of us a streak of artificiality, of self-consciousness,
a fondness for posing to seem better than we
are. But somewhere beneath the pose there is usually
a core of sincerity, a genuine individuality, perhaps a
poor thing but still a real thing. It may be there was
this reality somewhere in Edna. I can only say that
I was never granted a sight of it. And I rather suspect
that she, like most of the fashion-rotted women and men,
had lost by a process of atrophy through suppression
and disuse the last fragment of reality. Had Gabriel&#8217;s
trumpet sounded and the great light from the Throne
revealed the secrets of all hearts, it would have penetrated
in her to nothing but posing within posing.</p>

<p>I shall get no sympathy from man or woman&mdash;or
fellow-beast&mdash;after talking thus of a woman and a lady.
It is the convention to speak gallant lies to and about
women&mdash;and to treat them as if they were beneath contempt.
So my habit of treating them well and speaking
the truth about them will be condemned and denounced
with the triple curse. Well&mdash;I shall try to
live through it.</p>

<p>Except in occasional outbursts when her rude candor
toward me would anger me into retort in kind, I
concealed my feeling about her. I knew it was just,
yet I was ashamed of it. Our quarrels were all surface
affairs&mdash;outbursts of irritation&mdash;the blowing off of surplus
steam, not the bursting of the boiler and the wrecking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
of the machinery. If you happen to take into your
employ any of the servants we had in those days&mdash;Edna&#8217;s
maids or my valet or any other of the menials
so placed that they could spy upon our innermost
privacy&mdash;I am confident that in return for your adroit,
searching questionings you will hear we were no more
inharmonious than the usual married couple past the
best-foot-foremost stage. I did not swear at her; she
did not throw bric-&agrave;-brac at me. And once, I remember,
when I had a bad headache she stayed home from the
opera&mdash;on a Monday night, too&mdash;to read to me. It is
true the new dress in which she had expected to show
herself was not ready. But that is a detail for a cynic
to linger upon.</p>

<p>Three months of New York, and she was bored to
extinction. I had confidently been expecting this. I
watched the signs of it with gnawing anxiety, for I
was very near to the end of my good behavior. If
possible I wished to stay on and help her toward a
rational frame of mind&mdash;one in which she would see
that divorce was the only possible solution of our impossible
situation. But I began to fear I should have
to give up and fly&mdash;to hunt or to inspect western mines
and railways. She was bored by the women; they
seemed shallow dabblers in culture after the European
women. She was offended by their nervousness about
their position; it made them seem common in contrast
with the Europeans, born swells and impregnably ensconced.
She was bored by the men&mdash;by their fewness,
by the insufferable dullness of those few&mdash;all of them
feeble imitations of the European type of elegant loafer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>&#8220;These men have no subtlety,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;They
have no conversation. When they&#8217;re alone with a woman&mdash;you
should hear them try to flatter. They are
as different from the European men as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a fence-painter from an artist,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite that,&#8221; said she, and I saw her making a
mental note of the comparison for future use&mdash;one of
her best tricks. &#8220;Really, I prefer the business men
to them. But one cannot get the business men. What
a country, where everyone who has any brains is at
work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are unhappy here, why not go abroad?&#8221;
said I amiably. &#8220;Margot is always waiting for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how <i>can</i> I go abroad?&#8221; railed she. &#8220;There&#8217;ll
be another outbreak of scandal. Was ever a woman so
wretchedly placed! What <i>shall</i> I do! If I had some
one to advise me!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was interesting to hear her, determined, self-reliant
character though she was, thus confess to the
universal weakness of the female sex. Women, not
trained to act for themselves, can hardly overcome this
fundamental defect. That is why you so often see an
apparently, and probably, superior woman weaken and
yield where a distinctly ordinary man would be strong
and would march ahead. The trouble with Edna was
that she had no definite man behind her, spurring her
on to action. In all she had done from the beginning
of our married life she had felt that she had me to fall
back on, should emergency arise&mdash;an unconscious dependence,
one she would have scornfully denied, but none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
the less real. In this affair there was no man to fall
back on.</p>

<p>I saw this. Yet I refrained from giving her the
support she needed and all but asked. Her cry, &#8220;If I
had some one to advise me,&#8221; meant, &#8220;If I had some one
to give me the courage to act.&#8221; I knew what it meant.
But eager though I was to be quit of her, I would not
give her the thrust toward divorce that would have put
into her the courage of anger and of the feeling that
she was a martyr to my brutality. Why did I hold
myself in check? Candidly, I do not know. I distrust
the suggestion that it may have been due to essential
goodness of heart. At any rate, I did restrain myself.
She&mdash;naturally enough&mdash;misunderstood; and she proceeded
to explain it to the gratifying of her vanity. I
saw in her eyes, in her way of treating me, that she
thought me her secret adorer, convinced of my unworthiness,
of her god-to-mortal superiority; not daring
openly to resist her desire to be free from me, but
opposing it humbly, silently. I saw that she pitied me.
Did this add to my anger? Not in the least. I have
a perhaps queer sense of humor. I rather welcomed
the chance to get a little amusement out of a situation
otherwise dreary and infuriating.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it was Armitage who came to her
rescue&mdash;and to mine.</p>

<p>Bob had been in retirement several weeks, having
himself rejuvenated by a beauty doctor. You are astonished,
gentle reader, perhaps incredulous, that a
man of his position&mdash;high both socially and financially&mdash;should
stoop to such triviality&mdash;not a woman but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
man. And the serious, masculine sort of man he was,
I assure you. But you, being a confirmed accepter of
the trash written and talked about human nature, do
not appreciate what a power physical vanity is in the
world. Of course, if you are a man, you know about
your own carefully hid physical vanity. But you
think it in yourself a virtue, quite natural, not a vanity
at all. Bob Armitage was not vain enough to fail to
see the beginning of the ravages of time and dissipation.
Another man would have looked in the glass and
would have seen a reflection ever handsomer as the
years went by, would have discovered in the creases and
crow&#8217;s-feet and lengthening wattles a superb beauty of
manly strength of character showing at last in the face.
Bob was not that sort of fool. He wished to fascinate
the ladies; so, he strove to retain the fair insignia of
youth as long as he possibly could. He knew as well
as the next man that his wealth had value with the
women far beyond any degree of beauty or charm. But
like most men he wished to feel that he was at least not
a &#8220;winner&#8221; in spite of his personal self; and his young
good looks even helped toward the pleasantest of delusions&mdash;that
he was loved for himself chiefly.</p>

<p>The beauty doctor did well by him, I must say. He
looked ten years younger, would have passed in artificial
light for a youth of thirty or thereabouts. He reappeared
in his haunts, freshened up mentally, too;
for physical content reacts powerfully upon the mind,
and while it is true that feeling young helps one to look
young, it is truer that looking young compels one to
feel young.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>With him came a Prince Frascatoni, head of one of
the great families of Italy, one of the few that have
retained German titles and estates from the days of the
Holy Roman Empire. Frascatoni was sufficiently rich
for all ordinary purposes, and could therefore pose as
a traveler for pleasure with no matrimonial designs.
He was, in fact, poor for a <i>grand seigneur</i> and was
on the same business in America that has attracted
here every other visiting foreigner of rank&mdash;except
those who come for political purposes, and those
who come to shoot in the West. And those classes
give our fashionable society as wide a berth as
they would its middle-class prototype in their home
countries.</p>

<p>The first time I saw Frascatoni&mdash;when he and Armitage
strolled into the reading room of the Federal
Club together&mdash;I thought him about the handsomest
and, in a certain way, the most distinguished-looking
man I had ever seen. He was a black Italian&mdash;dark
olive skin, coal-black hair, dark-gray eyes that seemed
black or brown at a glance. They were weary-looking
eyes; they gazed at you with the ineffable dreamy
satiric repose of a sphinx who has seen the futile human
procession march into the grave for countless centuries.
He had a slow sweet smile, a manner made superior by
the effacement of every trace of superiority. He had
the quiet, leisurely voice of one used to being listened
to attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loring&mdash;the Prince Frascatoni. Prince, I particularly
wish you to know my friend Godfrey Loring.
Don&#8217;t be deceived by his look of the honest simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
youth into thinking him either young or unsophisticated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince gave me his hand. As it had also been
my habit ever since I learned the valuable trick merely
to give my hand, the gesture was a draw. Neither had
trapped the other into making an advance. We talked
commonplaces of New York sky line, American energy
and business enthusiasm for perhaps half an hour.
Then we three and some one else, a professional cultivator
of millionaires named Chassory, I believe, played
bridge and afterwards dined together. It came out
sometime during the evening that Frascatoni had met
my wife in Rome and in Paris, and that he knew my
son-in-law&mdash;not surprising, as the fashionable set is international,
and is small enough to be acquainted all
round.</p>

<p>Armitage must have told him that my wife and I
were not altogether inconsolable if we did not see too
much of each other. For, the prince, taking Edna in
to dinner a few nights later, laid siege at once. I recall
noting how he would talk to her in his quiet, leisurely
way until she looked at him; then, how his weary eyes
would suddenly light up with interest&mdash;not with ardor&mdash;nothing
so banal as that&mdash;but a fleeting gleam of interest
that was more flattering than the ardor of another
man would have been. As Frascatoni, an unusual
type, attracted me, I saved myself from boredom
by observing him all evening. And it was highly instructive
in the art of winning&mdash;whether women or men&mdash;to
see how he led her on to try to make that fascinating
fugitive gleam reappear in his eyes. I afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
discovered that he accompanied the gleam with a peculiar
veiled caress of inflection in his calm, even voice&mdash;a
trick that doubly re&euml;nforced the flattery of the gleam.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a charming man Prince Frascatoni is,&#8221; said
my wife, when our guests were gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said I. &#8220;If I were writing a novel I&#8217;d
make him the hero&mdash;or the villain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is one of the greatest nobles in Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks it and acts it,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought him very simple and natural,&#8221;
protested she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said I. &#8220;So many of the nobles I&#8217;ve
met looked and acted like frauds. They seemed afraid
it wouldn&#8217;t be known that they were of the aristocracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are prejudiced,&#8221; said Edna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do I size up Frascatoni so well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You happen to like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Edna with sarcasm. &#8220;He
isn&#8217;t in business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t do anything&mdash;build
a railroad, run a factory, write a book,
paint a picture. He and his kind are simply amateurs
at life, and their pretense that they could be professionals
if they chose ought to deceive nobody. He probably
could ride a horse a little worse than a professional
jockey, or handle a foil almost as well as a fencing
master, or play on the piano or the violin passably.
I don&#8217;t admire that sort of people, and I can&#8217;t like
where I don&#8217;t admire.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>Edna yawned and prepared to go up to her own
rooms. &#8220;I hope he&#8217;ll stay a while,&#8221; said she. &#8220;And
I hope he&#8217;ll let me see something of him. He&#8217;s the first
ray of interest I&#8217;ve had this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see something of him,&#8221; said I. &#8220;He
liked you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; said she, seating herself on the
arm of a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. Unless he finds what he&#8217;s looking for,
he&#8217;ll attach himself to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he looking for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very rich wife,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But she must be attractive
as well as rich, Armitage tells me. Frascatoni
doesn&#8217;t need money badly enough to annex a frump.
And Armitage says that while Englishmen and Germans
and the heiress-hunting sort of French don&#8217;t care
a rap what the lady looks like, the Italians&mdash;of the
old families&mdash;are rather particular&mdash;not exacting,
but particular. Unless, of course, the fortune is
huge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edna yawned again. That sort of talk either irritated
or bored her.</p>

<p>Frascatoni was constantly with her thenceforth&mdash;not
pointedly or scandalously so; there are discreet ways
of doing those things, and of discretion in all its forms
the Italian was a supreme master. The game of man
and woman had been his especial game from precocious
and maddeningly handsome boyhood. He had learned
both by being conquered and by conquering. They say&mdash;and
I believe it&mdash;that of all the foreigners a clean
Italian nobleman is the most fascinating.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>The Hungarian or Russian is a wild, barbaric love-maker,
the German a wordy sentimentalist, the Englishman
dominates and absorbs, the Frenchman knows
how to flatter the most subtly, how to make the woman
feel that life with him would be full of interest and charm.
But the right sort of Italian combines the best of all
these qualities, and adds to them the allure of the unfathomably
mysterious. He constantly satisfies yet
always baffles. He reveals himself, only to disclose in
the inner wall of what seemed to be his innermost self
a strangely carved door ajar.</p>

<p>My first intimation of what Frascatoni was about
came from my wife. Not words, of course, but actions.
She abruptly ceased quarreling, rebuking, reproaching,
scoffing. She soothed, sympathized, agreed. She became
as sweet as she had formerly been. I was puzzled,
and waited for light. It came with her next move.
She began to talk of going back to Europe, to deplore
that scandalmongers would not let her. She began to
chaff me on my love of a bachelor&#8217;s life, on my dislike
of married life. She said with reproachful, yet
smiling gentleness, that I made her feel ashamed to
stay on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that you&#8217;d be better pleased if
I were in Guinea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t have given me so many years of
freedom,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have been glad if I had gone on and gotten
a divorce,&#8221; pursued she.</p>

<p>My drowsing soul startled and listened. &#8220;I was
willing that you should do as you liked,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Divorce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
is a matter of more importance to the woman than
to the man&mdash;just as marriage is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a sensible thing, too&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey, would you honestly be willing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d not lay a straw in your way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense we&#8217;re talking!&#8221; cried she, with a
nervous laugh. &#8220;And yet there&#8217;s no denying that we
don&#8217;t get on together. I see how trying it is to you to
have me about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you want to be free and living abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how much I&#8217;d really mind the scandal,&#8221;
pursued she. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care especially about these New
York people. And at the worst what harm could they
do <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;They could only talk. How they&#8217;d blame me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Behind your back, perhaps,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Unless they
thought I was to blame&mdash;which is more likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk of divorce as if it were nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s merely a means to an end,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got only the one life, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m no longer so <i>dreadfully</i> young. Though,
I heard that Armitage said the other day he would never
dream I was over twenty-eight if he didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed with the pleasure we all take in a compliment
that is genuine; for she knew as well as did
Armitage that she could pass for twenty-eight&mdash;and a
radiant twenty-eight&mdash;even in her least lovely hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one has youth to waste,&#8221; observed I. &#8220;In your
heart you wish to be free&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;We are not suited to each other, Godfrey,&#8221; said
she with gentle friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a doubt of that,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we spoil each other&#8217;s lives? I conceal
it from you, but I am so unhappy here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t blame <i>me</i>,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;m not detaining
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence, then she said: &#8220;Suppose I were to
consent&mdash;&#8221; I laughed, she reddened, corrected herself:
&#8220;Suppose we were to decide to do it&mdash;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;a divorce,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t those things be done quietly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. No publicity until the decree is entered
and the papers sealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean no scandal beyond just the fact?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No scandal at all. Just the fact, and some newspaper
comment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we needn&#8217;t be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it take long?&#8221;</p>

<p>I reflected. &#8220;Let me see&mdash;if you begin action say
within a month, the divorce would take&mdash; I could have
it pushed through in another month or so, and then&mdash;by
next fall you&#8217;d be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t one have to have grounds for divorce,
beside not wanting to be married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All that easily arranges itself,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She lapsed into a deep study, I furtively watching
her. I saw an expression of fright, at the daring of her
thoughts, gather&mdash;fright, yet fascination, too. Said she
in a low voice: &#8220;Godfrey, are you <i>serious</i>?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>&#8220;Entirely so,&#8221; was my careless reply. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I am or not.... I am
<i>wretched</i> here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All you have to do is to say the word. We don&#8217;t
in the least need each other, and mutual need is the only
respectable excuse for marriage. And I must tell you,
I&#8217;ll not stand for any more of this social nonsense that
compels me to participate. I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me pityingly. Our season had been a
brilliant success, yet I remained unconverted, coarsely unsympathetic.
&#8220;If I should decide to&mdash;to do it&mdash;what
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;d go away. The rest would be for the
lawyers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me dazedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see&mdash;I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; she
said, and went to her own part of the house.</p>

<p>A week passed. Frascatoni sailed for home, sending
by her his polite regrets at not having seen me before
his departure. I waited, confident. I knew she had a
definite goal at last, and, therefore, a definite purpose.
Aside from the danger of frightening her back by showing
my own eagerness there was the matter of property.
I was willing to pay a good round price for freedom.
I have always hated money wrangles; I had never had
one with her, and I did not purpose to have. On the
other hand, that is, on her side, she would have given me
short shrift had it not been that she wished a slice of my
fortune&mdash;and a generous slice&mdash;to add to her own. I&#8217;ve
not a doubt that the fierce social campaign she put me
through that winter was not so much for her own pleasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
though she delighted in it, as for goading me to
demand a divorce, and, so, enable her to ease her conscience
and to drive a better bargain.</p>

<p>My seeming indifference, combined with her now
trembling eagerness to be free and away, soon forced
her hand. The break came on a Sunday afternoon. Life
is so inartistic&mdash;that is, from the standpoint of the cheap
novelists and playwrights with their dramatic claptrap.
Here is how the grand crash was precipitated:</p>

<p>Said I: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m off for a few weeks&#8217; fishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not starting now?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Day after to-morrow,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve made several engagements for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a substitute,&#8221; said I. &#8220;No one will miss me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How inconsiderate you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty good&mdash;after all I&#8217;ve borne this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are insufferable!&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;why suffer me?&#8221; said I coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you torture me much further, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll clear out to-night,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;With people coming to dinner to-morrow! A big
dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;to-night,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I had forgotten to-morrow&#8217;s
horrors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were free!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I <i>will</i> be free!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send you a lawyer at eleven to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>She was pale and trembling. The quarrel was a
mere pretense&mdash;a pretext so flimsy that each knew the
other was not deceived by it. Her tones of anger, my
tones of abrupt and contemptuous indifference were obviously
false and forced. As I left the room I cast a
furtive glance at her, saw that her daring was so terrifying
her that she could hardly keep a plausible front of
haughty anger.</p>

<p>It was several hours before I could get away from
the house, though I made all haste. Every moment I
expected some word from her. But none came. I sent
the lawyer the following morning. I was surprised when
later in the day, by the necessary roundabout way, I
learned that she had actually consented.</p>

<p>She showed that she had made an exhaustive study
of the subject, like the wise campaigner she was. She
thoroughly understood how to proceed; for, she told her
lawyer&mdash;the one of my lawyers whom I assigned to her&mdash;that
my coldness to her had filled her with suspicion
and that she wished detectives employed. She needed
no coaching whatever; he found her prepared on every
point.</p>

<p>How far had matters gone between her and Frascatoni?
Not so far as you imagine; but perhaps farther
than I think. Both the husband and the world are
poor judges in those affairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall pass over the suit. It was commonplace
throughout. There has been much speculation as to the
person named by my wife in the sealed papers. I can
truthfully say that I know as little about that person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
as does the public. It is usually so, I believe, in these
arranged suits. I did not appear at any of the hearings,
all of them held secretly. Nor did Edna appear,
though I believe that, to comply with the forms of law,
she made some sort of deposition in the presence of the
lawyers for both sides. It so happened that the first
and only public step&mdash;the judge&#8217;s ordering of the decree
of divorce&mdash;was published on the same day with the
news of a big prize fight, a sensational murder, and a
terrific earthquake. So, we got off with little public attention.
At the time the law provided that a decree
should not become valid for six months. We were nominally
free; but actually neither could marry again for
six months and meanwhile either of us could reopen the
case&mdash;and she could by merely requesting put an end
to it and restore her status as my wife. So, I was free&mdash;unless
Edna should change her mind sometime within
the six months.</p>

<p>Edna was in London and I in Paris when the news
came. Curiously enough, as I stood in the doorway of
the Ritz restaurant, that evening, looking about for a
table where I could dine alone, in came Prince Frascatoni
with another Italian whose name I cannot recall. I
bowed to Frascatoni. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are alone, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unluckily, yes,&#8221; replied I.</p>

<p>He introduced his companion and suggested that we
three dine at the same table. &#8220;Why not share our dinner?&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I can easily change my order. Perhaps
you will go with us afterwards to some amusing
little plays in a Montmartre theater?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>I accepted the courteous invitation. The situation
appealed to my sense of humor. Also I knew that Edna&mdash;toward
whom I now felt most kindly&mdash;would be delighted
to read in the papers: &#8220;Prince Frascatoni had
as his guest at dinner last night Mr. Godfrey Loring.&#8221;
It would put an immediate stop to any tendency to gossip.
As the prince did not speak of my former wife I
assumed that he had heard the news.</p>

<p>When we were separating I said: &#8220;You will dine
with me to-morrow night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I&#8217;m leaving town in the morning,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>I thought I could guess which way he was journeying.
With perhaps a twinkle in my eyes, I said: &#8220;So
soon? Well&mdash;thank you, and good-by&mdash;and good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought I saw a sardonic smile flit over his face.
He probably imagined I was in the dark as to his
maneuverings and designs and smiled to himself as he
thought, &#8220;How differently this American would be
treating me if he knew!&#8221; Do not fancy, because Edna
had no charm for me, I thought it strange she should
have charm for other men. Nothing could be further
from the truth. I appreciated her attractive points
perhaps more than any other man possibly could. Also,
I appreciated&mdash;and still appreciate&mdash;that another man
would not be so peculiarly annoyed by her lack of any
sense of humor as I was. Indeed, had not circumstances
forced me into the acutely critical mood toward her, I
doubt not I could have continued to bear with that lack,
though it made conversation with her all but impossible
and precipitated quarrels without number.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>Beyond question the strongest and most enduring
hold a man can get upon a woman or a woman upon a
man is the physical. We&mdash;even the least intellectual of
us&mdash;are something more than physical; but the physical
must be contented first, and must remain contented, because
we are first of all physical. The physical is the
fundamental; but it takes more than foundations to make
a house. And a marriage such as ours was could not endure.
Each of us had but the one charm for the other.
It wore itself out like a fire that is not supplied with fuel.</p>

<p>If I had not fallen in love with another woman, there
might have remained a feeling for Edna that would
have made me jealous, perhaps domineering toward her.
As it was, I viewed her calmly; when I said &#8220;good luck&#8221;
to Frascatoni, I meant it. I hoped he would make Edna
happy, for, I wished her well.</p>

<p>Through Armitage I had provided myself with Mary
Kirkwood&#8217;s address&mdash;an apartment overlooking the Parc
Monceau which she and Neva Armstrong had taken for
the spring months. That very afternoon I went to leave
cards. As I feared she was not at home. &#8220;But,&#8221; said
Mrs. Armstrong, &#8220;you may find her walking in the
park with Hartley Beechman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is he here?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>You may picture me as suddenly dashed down by this
word whose meaning there was no mistaking. If so, you
have discovered little about me in these pages. Life had
made me a competent judge of the situation that is really
hopeless, the situation where to struggle is folly, and
that situation which seems hopeless to the small of earth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
accustomed to defeat in their desires, but seems only difficult
to the other sort of human beings.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has taken a studio over in the Latin quarter,&#8221;
continued Mrs. Armstrong. &#8220;We are all going back
together in July.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong is an attractive woman&mdash;singularly
so for one who is obviously wholly absorbed in her husband.
She has the sort of personality her paintings
prepare you to expect. But I had difficulty in concealing
my impatience to get away. I strolled several times
through the park, which is not large, before I finally came
upon Mary and Beechman seated in one of the less-frequented
paths. As I was moving directly toward them,
both saw me at the same instant. Her welcoming smile
was radiant. I did not notice his, but I assume it was
more reserved.</p>

<p>Never had I seen her looking so well. You may
say what you please, but an American woman who knows
how to dress, in touch with a French dressmaker who is
rather artist than dressmaker, is the supreme combination
for &aelig;sthetic beauty. Mrs. Kirkwood, of the
ivory skin and the coal-black hair, was a thrilling sight
to see in her white dress and big black hat, with that
background of fresh spring foliage and late afternoon
light. Her eyes and her smile, I noted for the first time,
had somewhat the same quality as Frascatoni&#8217;s&mdash;the
weary eyes, the slow sweet smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Loring!&#8221; she cried, rising and extending her
hand impulsively. &#8220;I thought I was never to see you
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hid my emotion and greeted her, then Beechman, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
my habitual manner which, they tell me, is the reverse of
effusive. I suppose, when I am deeply moved, its lack
of cordiality becomes even more pronounced. After a
few minutes of the talk necessary among acquaintances
who have not met in a long time Beechman rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Beechman will dine with me, I hope?&#8221; I
said. &#8220;Mrs. Armstrong says she will go if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was arranged and, as the day was warm, d&#8217;Armenonville
was fixed upon as the place. &#8220;Until half-past
eight,&#8221; said Beechman as he left. Mary and I sat silent
watching him walk away. A superb figure of young
manhood, supremely fortunate in that his body was an
adequate expression of a strong and simple nature.</p>

<p>As he passed from view at the turn of the walk I
transferred my gaze to her. Her eyes slowly lowered,
and a faint flush came into her cheeks. Said I:</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw the news&mdash;about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartley and I were talking of it as you appeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not surprised?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and no,&#8221; replied she, with constraint and
some confusion. &#8220;A year or so ago I&mdash;people thought&mdash;you
and she had&mdash;had drifted apart. Then it looked
as though you had come together again. It seemed the
natural thing. She is beautiful and has so much charm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was unhappy in America. She wished to be
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary looked at me reflectively. &#8220;You are not&mdash;inconsolable,
I see,&#8221; said she with a smile of faint raillery.
&#8220;My brother has often told me about you&mdash;how indifferent
you are to women. Perhaps that is why you are
attractive to them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; said I. &#8220;I did not know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are terribly impersonal,&#8221; she went on laughingly.
&#8220;Last summer I&mdash;well, I was not&mdash;that is, not
exactly&mdash;trying to flirt with you. But your absolute unconsciousness
of me as a woman was often very&mdash;baffling.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;You thought that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I help seeing it? Why, you treated me
precisely as if I were another man. Not that I didn&#8217;t
like it, on the whole. A woman gets tired of being always
on guard.&#8221; She smiled at herself. &#8220;That sounds
horribly conceited. But you know what I mean. The
men never lose a chance to practice. Then, too&mdash;well, if
a woman has the reputation of being rich she need not
flatter herself that it is her charms that do all the drawing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the supreme curse of money&mdash;it all but cuts
one off from love and friendship. Fortunately it, to a
great extent, takes the place of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear you say that,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many poor people get love and friendship?&#8221;
replied I. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the truth that there is little&mdash;very,
very little&mdash;real love or friendship in the world? All I
meant was that money, and the independence and comfort
and the counterfeit of affection it brings, are better
than nothing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You are so sensible&mdash;and
you don&#8217;t cant. That was why I liked to talk with you.
At first I thought you cynical and hard. That&#8217;s the first
impression plain good sense makes. We are used to
hearing only shallow sentimentality.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>&#8220;The unending flapdoodle,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flapdoodle,&#8221; agreed she. &#8220;Then&mdash;I began to discover
that you were anything but hard&mdash;that you looked
at people as they are, and liked them for themselves, not
for what they pretended to be. I was beginning to trust
you&mdash;to venture timidly in the direction of being my
natural self&mdash;when you left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;here I am again,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And we start in
afresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled with embarrassment. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said
hesitatingly. &#8220;But the circumstances have changed
somewhat.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know full well now what I should have said. I
should have replied, &#8220;Yes&mdash;we are both almost free&mdash;but
soon will be altogether free&mdash;I in six months, you as
soon as you break your engagement.&#8221; That would have
been bold and intelligent&mdash;for it is always intelligent to
make the issue clear at the earliest possible moment. But
I did not speak. I remained silent. Why? Because as
I was talking with her I was realizing that I had been
deceiving myself in a curious fashion. I had been so concentratedly
in love with her&mdash; Gentle reader, I see the
mocking smile on your shallowly sentimental face. You
are ridiculing a love that could have such restraint as
mine&mdash;that could bear with Edna, could wait, could refrain
from any of the familiar much-admired impetuosities
and follies. You cannot understand. In this day
when men no longer regard or feel their responsibilities
in taking a more or less helpless woman to wife, your
sense of the decencies is utterly corrupted. But let me
say that no matter how ardently and romantically a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
may conduct himself, a woman would do well to take care
how she trusts him if he has a bad or even a doubtful
record as to his way of meeting his responsibilities of
whatever sort. That kind of love may &#8220;listen good,&#8221; but
it does not &#8220;live good.&#8221; However&mdash;as I was about to
say when your smile interrupted me, my all-absorbing
love for Mary Kirkwood had misled me into assuming,
with no reason whatsoever, that she understood all,
that she knew I was eager to come to her, and would
come as soon as I could. You will say this was absurd.
Granted. But is not a man in love always absurd?
You will say it was egotistical. Granted. But is not
a man in love always egotistical? It is not the realities
but the delusions that keep us going; and in those
long months of waiting, of hoping often against hope,
I had to have a delusion to keep me going. But now,
her friendly, simply friendly, way of talking to me
made me see that I had her yet to win, that I could
not speak out directly as I had planned. You, who probably
know women well, may say that this was a mistake.
Perhaps. Nevertheless <i>I</i> could not have done
otherwise.</p>

<p>You will say that women do not know their own
minds, but have to be told. I admit it. You will say
my silence was timidity. I admit it. I could not talk
of love to a woman until I was sure she wished to hear.
I had the timidity of the man to whom woman and love
are serious matters; the timidity unknown to the man
who makes love to every passable female at whom he has
a chance; the timidity which all women profess to approve,
but which, I more than suspect, appeals only to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
the jaded palate of the woman who has long made love
and passion her profession.</p>

<p>As Beechman was busy with a novel I had everything
my own way without strategy during those following
days. There are a thousand attractive places to go in
and near Paris, and I was resourceful in contriving excursions
for the days when there was no chance of seeing
only her. Almost every day the London papers or the
Paris <i>Herald</i> printed something about Edna and the brilliant
season she was having in London; often not far
away from her name in a list of guests was the name of
Prince Frascatoni. My own activities, more Bohemian
as was my taste and the taste of my friends&mdash;and I may
say the taste of civilized and intelligent Paris&mdash;my activities
were not recorded in the papers. I fancied they
were unobserved. I was soon to be undeceived.</p>

<p>I wonder who the people are that write anonymous
letters&mdash;and give anonymous &#8220;tips&#8221; to society journals?
Every once in a while by mischance&mdash;often by my having
made a remark that was misinterpreted into something
malicious or low, utterly foreign to my real meaning&mdash;I
have had some fellow-being suddenly unveil a noisome
corner in his or her soul for confidently awaited sympathy;
and I have almost literally shrunk back in my
horror at the cesspool of coarseness, or at the vicious
envy. Have you had that experience? No doubt scattered
among us ordinary folk, neither particularly good
nor particularly bad, well rather than ill-disposed and
amiable, if not too severely tried or tempted&mdash;no doubt,
scattered among us there are not a few of these swine
souls or snake souls, hid beneath a pleasant smile and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
fine raiment. And these are they who give off the foulness
of the anonymous letters and the anonymous tip.</p>

<p>In one of the minor London society papers appeared
this paragraph which I am sure I quote word for word:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;American Paris is much amused these beautifully
fine spring days with the ardent love-making
of a recently divorced railway &#8216;baron.&#8217; The lady
is herself a divorcee of several years standing and
is supposed to be engaged to a famous young literary
man who is all unaware of what is going on.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>I know of five copies of this journal that were mailed
with the paragraph marked. The five were received by
Edna, Margot, myself, Mary Kirkwood, and Hartley
Beechman. I have often mentally gone through the list
of my acquaintances in search of the person who was responsible
for this thing. I have some extremely unpleasant
characters in that list. But I have never been able
to suspect who did it. Not improbably the guilty person
is some one in other respects not a bad sort&mdash;for
almost any given cut from that vast universal, human
nature, contains something of everything.</p>

<p>I had an engagement with Mary Kirkwood to walk
in the Bois and have tea the afternoon of the day this
paragraph reached me. When I arrived at her apartment
she came down ready to go. Her costume was so
lovely and I so delighted in her that I did not immediately
note the heavy circles round her eyes nor the
drawn expression of her mouth. I did not dream that
she knew of the paragraph. I had read it and had dismissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
it from my mind. The anonymous letter and the
anonymous newspaper attack were old familiar stories to
me, as they are to every man who attains distinction in
active life. But as we drove toward the Bois I happened
to catch a glimpse of her by way of the mirror in
the frame of the taxi. I saw the evidence of suffering&mdash;and
the wistful, weary look in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said I. &#8220;You have had bad news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk of it now,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Wait until
we are in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after we passed the entrance gates we descended
and rambled away over the not too even ground,
along the indistinct paths under the fascinating little
trees. It was a gorgeous, perfumed May day. You
know the Bois&mdash;how lovely it is, how artfully it mingles
the wild and the civilized, suggesting nature as a
laughing nymph with tresses half bound, half free,
with graceful young form half clad, half nude. We
rambled on and on, and after half an hour seated ourselves
where there were leaves and the slim graceful
trunks on every side and the sound of falling water
like the musical voice of the sunbeams.</p>

<p>Mary drew a long sigh. &#8220;I feel better,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I looked at her. &#8220;You <i>are</i> better. You have
shaken it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>She met my gaze. &#8220;This is the last time,&#8221; she said.
She looked away, repeated softly, thoughtfully, &#8220;the
last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>&#8220;We are not going to see each other any more.
It is being misunderstood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced quickly at her, and I knew she had read
the paragraph. &#8220;That miserable scandal sheet!&#8221; said
I. &#8220;No one sees it&mdash;and if they did why should we
notice anything so ridiculous?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer immediately. After a while she
said: &#8220;Perhaps I ought not to say it, but&mdash;Hartley is
sensitive. A copy of the paper got to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One to me. One to you. One to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; said she. &#8220;The mischief is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not give up a friend lightly,&#8221; rejoined I.
The time to speak was at hand; I welcomed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He</i> has asked me to give you up,&#8221; said she simply.
&#8220;And I shall do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has no right to ask such a thing,&#8221; protested
I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;he has. He and I are engaged&mdash;you knew
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagined there was some sort of an engagement,&#8221;
said I, still waiting for the right opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one sort of engagement possible
with me,&#8221; replied she, with a certain gentle reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But I remember the talk
we had on the yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush overspread her paleness for a moment.
Then she rose from the little rustic iron chair. &#8220;We
must go,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said I. And I made a tactless, a stupid
beginning: &#8220;You can&#8217;t deny that you do not love
him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>She turned coldly away and walked on, I following.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll not stop for tea,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Will you
hail the first taxi we meet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are offended&mdash;Mary?&#8221; I said. What a blundering
fool love does make of a man!&mdash;unless he makes
a fool of it.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No&mdash;not offended. But
when a subject comes up about which we may not talk
there is nothing to do but drop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In my desperation I reached for the right chord
and struck it. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said I, &#8220;why I left
the yacht abruptly?&#8221;</p>

<p>She halted, gave me a swift, frightened glance.
The color flooded her face, then fled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that was why,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And&mdash;I&#8217;ve come
as soon as I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why, why didn&#8217;t you <i>tell</i> me?&#8221; cried she.
Then, before I could answer, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that. I
understand.&#8221; Then, with a wild look around, &#8220;<i>What</i>
am I saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come for you, Mary,&#8221; I went on. &#8220;And you
are not going to rush into folly a second time&mdash;a
greater folly. For&mdash;you do not love him&mdash;and you will
care for me. You are right, we can&#8217;t discuss him&mdash;you
and him. But we can, and must, discuss you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not see you again,&#8221; said she, looking at me
with tranquil eyes that would have daunted me had I
not known her so well, understood her so well&mdash;which is
only another way of saying, had I not loved her so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you been seeing me day after day,
when you knew that I loved you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>&#8220;I did not know it,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;I did not think
I could move you in the least&mdash;beyond a friendly liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>An inflection in her voice made me suddenly realize.
&#8220;You came because it made you happy to come!&#8221; I
cried triumphantly. I caught her hand. &#8220;You do
care, Mary!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her hand away resolutely. &#8220;I shall keep
my promise,&#8221; she said coldly. &#8220;I wish to hear no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not keep your promise. If necessary
I&#8217;ll go to him and tell him&mdash;and he&#8217;ll release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me a look that withered. &#8220;You&mdash;do a
cowardly thing like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But <i>you</i> will ask him to release
you. You have no right to marry him. And I&mdash;I
love you&mdash;and must live my life with you, or&mdash;I can
think of nothing more futile and empty than life without
you. And your life&mdash;would it not be futile and
empty, Mary, if you tried to live it without me, when
we might have been together? Together!&mdash;you and I!
Mary, my love!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say those things, Godfrey?&#8221; she
cried passionately. &#8220;To make me wretched? To
make it harder for me to do what I must?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To make it impossible for you to do what you
must not. Marry a man you don&#8217;t love&mdash;marry him
when you love another! You&#8217;d be doing him the worst
possible injury. No matter how much he loves you, he
can recover from the blow of losing you. But the day
to day horror of such a loveless marriage would destroy
you both. He is a sensitive man. He would feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
it, in spite of all your efforts to pretend. You&mdash;pretend!
You could not do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After what has passed between him and me&mdash;the
promises we&#8217;ve exchanged&mdash;the plans we&#8217;ve made&mdash;there
is no going back! I don&#8217;t wish to go back. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary&mdash;I love you!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I love you&mdash;and
you love me. That&#8217;s the wall between you and any other
man, between me and any other woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had waved to a passing taxi. It swept into the
edge of the drive. She opened the door. &#8220;You are
not coming with me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I shall not see
you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laid my hand on her arm and forced her to meet
my gaze. &#8220;You are hysterical now,&#8221; I said. &#8220;But
you will be calm, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me a cold smile&mdash;it would have deceived
those who do not understand the temperaments that can
conceal themselves. &#8220;I am perfectly calm, I assure
you,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you were the first time we ever met,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve no right to marry any man but me, Mary.
If you did you&#8217;d be wronging yourself&mdash;me&mdash;him most
of all. That is the truth, and you will see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dragged her arm away, burst into violent sobs,
sank upon the seat of the cab. I hesitated&mdash;obeyed a
right instinct, closed the door, gave her address to the
ignoring chauffeur, stood watching the cab whisk away.
I was shaking from head to foot. But I had no fear
for the outcome. I knew that I had won&mdash;that <i>we</i> had
won.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rossiter</span>&mdash;I believe I have mentioned the name of
my new secretary&mdash;was lying in wait for me at the hotel
entrance. He read me a telegram from Margot: Edna
was ill, was not expected to live, begged me to come at
once.</p>

<p>I wrote to Mary Kirkwood&mdash;a brief repetition of
what I had said to her&mdash;&#8220;of what I know both your
intelligence and your heart are saying to you, dear.&#8221; I
told her that Edna was desperately ill and had sent for
me, and that I should be back as soon as I could get
away. I went on to say many things such as a man
deeply in love always says. No doubt it was a commonplace
letter, as sincere love letters are apt to be; but
because it was from my heart I felt that, for all the
shortcomings, it would go to her heart. I admit I am
not a facile love-maker. I have had little practice.
And I suspect, those who are facile at love-making have
got their facility by making love speeches so often when
they were not in earnest that they cannot but have lost
all capacity to be in earnest.</p>

<p>Toward noon the next day Rossiter and I and my
valet were set down at the little station of Kesson Wells,
half an hour out from London in Surrey. We were in
the midst of about as beautiful a country us I have seen.
I am a narrow enough patriot not to take the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
favorable view of things foreign. But I must admit
that no other countryside can give one the sense of sheer
loveliness that one gets in certain parts of England.
I am glad we have nothing like it at home; for to have it
means rainy weather most of the time, and serf labor,
and landlord selfishly indifferent to the misery of the
poor human creatures he works and robs. Still, I try
to forget the way it came in the joy of the thing itself&mdash;as
you, gentle reader, forget the suffering and death of
the animals that make the artistic and delicious course
dinners you eat.</p>

<p>We were received with much ceremony at the station.
My money was being exercised by those who knew
how to do it. After a drive between perfumed and blossoming
hedgerows and over a road as smooth and clean
as a floor we came to Garton Hall, the place my son-in-law
had leased until his new house should be ready.
It was a modern house, as I noted with relief when we
were still afar off, and while not large, was a most satisfactory
embodiment of that often misused and often
misunderstood word comfort. To live in the luxurious
yet comfortable comfort obtainable in England only&mdash;indoors,
in its steam-heated or Americanized portions&mdash;one
must have English servants. I am glad we do not
breed English servants in America; I am glad that when
they are imported they soon cease to be the models of
menial perfection they are at home. But when I am in
England I revel in the English servant. To find him
at his best you must see him serving in the establishment
of a great noble. And my son-in-law was that; and the
establishment over which Margot presided, but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
which she was not permitted to interfere in the smallest
detail because of her utter ignorance of all the &#8220;vulgarities&#8221;
of life, as became a true lady of our quaint
American brand&mdash;the establishment was a combination
of the best of the city with the best of the country, a
skillful mingling of the most attractive features of home,
club, and hotel.</p>

<p>My first question at the station had, of course, been
as to Mrs. Loring. I was assured that her ladyship&#8217;s
mother was somewhat better, but still awaiting the dangerous
crisis of the fever. Margot, not a whit less girlish
for her maternity, met me in the doorway, and had
the nurse there with the boy&mdash;the Earl of Gorse. They
said he looked like me&mdash;and he did, though I do not
believe they thought so. Why should they say it? I
was still a young man and might marry again. I fancy
the same prudent instinct prompted them to give him
Godfrey as one of his four or five names. Why do I
think they did not believe he looked like me? Because
all of them were ashamed of everything American. In
the frequent quarrels between Margot and Hugh, he
never failed to use the shaft that would surely pierce
the heart of her vanity and rankle there&mdash;her low American
birth, in such ghastly and grotesque contrast to the
illustrious descent of her husband. She had an acid
tongue when it came to quarreling; she could hurl taunts
about his shifts to keep up appearances before he met
her that made ugly and painful marks on his hide. She
had discovered, probably by gossiping with some traitor
servant, that he had been flouted by a rich English girl
for a chauffeur&mdash;and you may be sure she put it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
good use. But nothing she could say made him quiver
as she quivered when he opened out on the subject of
those &#8220;filthy bounders in the States.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not imagine, gentle reader, that my daughter
was unhappily married. She would not have exchanged
places with anyone but the wife of a duke; and Hugh&mdash;well,
he needed the money. Nor should you think that
they lived unhappily together. They saw little of each
other alone; and in public they were as smiling and
amiable with each other as&mdash;perhaps as you and your
husband.</p>

<p>A fine baby was the Earl of Gorse&mdash;one who in a
decent environment would have grown up a sensible,
useful person. But hardly, I feared, when he was already
living in his own separate apartment, with his
name&mdash;&#8220;The Earl of Gorse&#8221;&mdash;on a card beside the
door, and with all the servants, including his mother,
treating him as if he were of superior clay. This when
he barely had his sight. They say a baby learns the
utility of bawling at about three days old; I should say
the germ of snobbishness would get to work very soon
thereafter.</p>

<p>You are waiting to hear what was the matter with
Edna. No, it was not a fake illness to draw me within
reach for some further trimming. She had indeed fallen
dangerously ill&mdash;did not expect to live when Margot
telegraphed me. It was an intestinal fever brought on
by the excesses of the London season. I wonder when
the biographers, poets, playwrights, novelists, and other
gentry who give us the annals of the race will catch up
with the progress of science? How long will it be before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
they stop telling us of germ and filth diseases as
if they were the romantic physical expressions of soul
states? There was a time when such blunders were excusable.
Now, science has shown us that they are so
much twaddle. So, gentle reader, I cannot gratify your
taste for humbug and moonshine by telling you that
Edna was stricken of remorse or of overjoy or of secret
grief or of any other soul state whatever. The doctor
bosh was, of course, nervous exhaustion. It always is
if the patient is above the working class. The truth
was that she fell ill, even as you and I. She ate and
drank too much, both at and between meals, and did
not take proper care of herself in any way. She wore
dresses that were nearly nothing in cold carriages and
draughty rooms, when she was laden with undigested
food. Vulgar&mdash;isn&#8217;t it? Revolting for me to speak
thus of a lady? But I am trying to tell the truth,
gentle reader, not to increase your stock of slop and
lies which you call &#8220;culture.&#8221; And if a lady will put
herself in such a condition, why should it not be spoken
of? Why go on lying about these things, and encouraging
people to attribute to sensitive nerves and souls the
consequences of gluttony, ignorance, and neglect?</p>

<p>I am not criticising Edna for getting into such an
internal physical state that a pestilence began to rage
within her. The most intelligent of us is only too foolish
and ignorant in these matters, thanks to stupid education
from childhood up. And she has the added excuse
of having been exposed to the temptations of a
London season. She fell; it is hardly in human nature
not to fall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>You have been through a London season? It is a
mad chase from food to food. You rise and hastily
swallow a heavy English breakfast. You ride in the
Row a while, ride toward a lunch table&mdash;and an English
lunch, especially in the season, means a bigger dinner
than any Frenchman or other highly civilized person
ever willingly sat down to. Hardly is this long lunch
over before it is time for tea&mdash;which means not merely
tea, but toast, and sandwiches, and hot muffins, and
many kinds of heavy cake, and often fruit or jam. Tea
is to give you an appetite for the dinner that follows&mdash;and
what a dinner! One rich, heavy course upon another,
with drenchings of wine and a poisonous liqueur
afterward. You sit about until this has settled a bit,
then&mdash;on to supper! Not so formidable a meal as the
dinner, but still what any reasonable person would call
a square meal. Then to bed? By no means. On to a
ball, where you eat and drink in desultory fashion until
late supper is served. You roll heavily home to sleep.
But hardly have your eyes closed when you are roused to
eat again. It is breakfast time, and another day of
stuffing has begun.</p>

<p>Starvation, they tell me, is one of the regular causes
of death in London. But that is in the East End. In
the West End&mdash;and you, gentle reader, are interested
only in that section&mdash;death, I&#8217;ll wager, reaps twenty
from overfeeding to one he gets in the East End through
underfeeding. Famine is a dreadful thing. But how
characteristic of the shallowness of human beings it is
that you can make a poetic horror out of famine, when
no one would listen while you told the far more horrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
truth of the frightful ravages of overfeeding, chief
cause of all the diseases that torture and twist the human
body, aging and killing it prematurely.</p>

<p>Edna had been for many years most cautiously careful
of her health. She loved her youth, her beautiful
body. She fought against her natural fondness for
food and wine. I fancy that, for this first season after
freedom she relaxed her rules, and turned herself loose to
&#8220;celebrate.&#8221; I know she must have had something of
this sort in mind, because her French maid&mdash;I could not
talk with the Italian&mdash;told me that madame had arranged
an elaborate programme of &#8220;cures&#8221; on the Continent
after the season. &#8220;And they were to be serious
cures,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Her illness took such a course of ups and downs, with
death always hovering, that it was impossible for me to
leave. I wrote Mary; I got no reply. I sent Rossiter
to Paris; he reported that Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs.
Kirkwood had left for the country, but that he could
get no address.</p>

<p>You probably picture me as scarcely able to restrain
myself from acting like a madman. How little you
know of me! Do you think I could have achieved my
solid success before I reached forty-five years if I had
been one of the little people who fret and fume against
the inevitable? All men who amount to anything are
violent men. Jesus, the model of serenity and patience,
scourged the money changers from the temple. Washington,
one more great exemplar of the majesty of repose,
swore like a lunatic at the battle of Monmouth.
These great ones simply had in the highest form the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
virtues that make for success in every department
of leadership. Certainly, I am a violent man; but I
have rarely been foolish enough to go crazy to no
purpose.</p>

<p>What could I do but wait? And over that beautiful,
quiet country place floated the black cormorant,
with wings outspread and hollow, burning eyes bent
eagerly downward. I waited, not in fury, but oppressed
by a deep melancholy. For the first time in my life I
was thinking seriously of death. To any man no decisive
event of life is so absolutely unimportant as his
own death. I never have wasted, and never shall waste,
a moment in thinking of my death. It may concern
others, but how does it concern me? When it comes I
shall not be there. The death of another, however&mdash;that
is cause for reflection, for sadness. I knew, as did
no one else, how intensely Edna loved life, how in her
own way of strain and struggle she enjoyed it. And to
me it was pitiful, this spectacle of her sudden arrest, her
sudden mortal peril, as she was about to achieve the
summit of her ambition.</p>

<p>I wondered as to Frascatoni. I pictured him waiting,
with those tranquil, weary eyes already looking
about for another means to his aim of large fortune
should this means fail. There I misjudged him; for,
one day as I stood in a balcony overlooking the drive he
came rushing up in a motor, and my first glance at his
haggard face told me that he loved her. In a way it is
small compliment to a woman to be loved by the fortune-hunting
sort of man; for, he does not release himself
until he has the permit of basest self-interest. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
Frascatoni, having released himself, had fallen in love
with all the frenzy of his super-refined, passionately
imaginative nature.</p>

<p>After a few minutes he drove away. I do not know
what occurred&mdash;naturally, they would not speak of his
call and I did not ask questions. I can imagine, however.
She seemed better that day, and he must have
gone away reassured. He was sending, every morning,
enormous quantities of flowers; such skill and taste
showed in the arranging that I am sure it was not the
usual meaningless performance of rich people, who are
always trying to make money-spending serve instead of
thoughtful and delicate attention.</p>

<p>Nearly a month dragged along before she was able
to see me. As I have explained, her beauty was not
dependent upon evanescent charms of contour and coloring,
but was securely founded in the structure of her
head and face and body. So, I saw lying weakly in the
bed an emaciated but lovely Edna. Instantly, on sight
of her, there came flooding back to me the memory of
the birth of Margot, our first child&mdash;how Edna had
looked when they let me go into the humble, almost
squalid little bedroom in the flat of which we were so
vain. She was looking exactly so in this bed of state,
in this magnificent room with the evidences of wealth
and rank and fashion on every side. She smiled faintly;
one of the slim weak hands lying upon the cream-white
silk coverlet moved. I bent and kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for being here,&#8221; she murmured, tears
in her eyes. Her lips could scarcely utter the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not speak, your ladyship,&#8221; warned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
nurse. To flatter Americans and to give themselves the
comfortable feeling of gratified snobbishness English
servants address us&mdash;or rather our women&mdash;as if we had
titles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to get well rapidly now,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay until I can talk to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said&mdash;what else could I say?</p>

<p>They motioned me away. I had committed myself
to several weeks more of that futile monotony&mdash;and I no
longer had the restraint of the sense that she might die
at any moment.</p>

<p>Even had I been willing to break my promise I could
not have done so; for she would have me in every morning
and every afternoon to look at me, and they told
me that if I were not there to reassure her, it would
undoubtedly cause a change for the worse. I stayed
on and wrote to Mary Kirkwood&mdash;all the time with the
fear that my letters were not reaching her, but also
with the unshakable conviction that she was mine. You
smile at this as proof of my colossal vanity. Well, your
smile convicts you of never having loved. The essence
of love is congeniality. Appetite is the essence of passion&mdash;which,
therefore, has no sense of or especial desire
for mutuality. Passion is as common as any other
physical appetite. Love is as rare as are souls generous
enough to experience or to inspire it. The essence of
love is congeniality&mdash;and I <i>knew</i> there was a sympathy
and understanding between me and Mary Kirkwood that
made us lovers for all time.</p>

<p>There came a day&mdash;how it burned into my memory!&mdash;when
Edna was well enough to talk with me. Several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
days before and I saw that it was not far away, and I
awaited it with fierce impatience; she would tell me
why she had sent for me and I should be free to go. It
was one of those soft gray days of alternating rain
and sun that are the specialty of the British climate.
Edna, with flowers everywhere in her sitting room, was
half reclining in an invalid chair, all manner of rich,
delicate silk and lace assistants to comfort, luxury and
beauty adorning her or forming background for her
lovely face and head. I do not think there is a detail
of the room or of her appearance that I could not
reproduce, though at the time I was unaware of anything
but her voice&mdash;her words.</p>

<p>I entered, seated myself in the broad low window
opposite her. She looked at me a long time, a strange
soft expression in her weary eyes&mdash;an expression that
disquieted me. At last she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so good to be getting well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are getting well rapidly,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You
have a wonderful constitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are glad I am better, Godfrey?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;What a foolish question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I feared&mdash; I have
acted <i>so</i> badly toward you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about those
things. I hope you feel as friendly toward me as I do
toward you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have always been good to me&mdash;even when
I haven&#8217;t deserved it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was most puzzling. Said I vaguely, &#8220;I guess
we&#8217;ve both done the best we could. Do you want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
tell me to-day why you sent for me? Or don&#8217;t you feel
strong enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I wish to tell you to-day. But&mdash;it isn&#8217;t
easy to say. I&#8217;m very proud, Godfrey&mdash;and when I&#8217;ve
been in the wrong it&#8217;s hard for me to admit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, Edna,&#8221; said I soothingly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
not rake up the past. It&#8217;s finished&mdash;and it has left no
hard feeling&mdash;at least not in me. Don&#8217;t think of anything
but of getting well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay gazing out into the gentle rain with the
sunshine glistening upon it. A few large tears rolled
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to be unhappy about,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;You are far on the way to health. You are as lovely
as ever. And you will get everything you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s so hard to tell you!&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t,&#8221; I urged. &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything I
can do for you, let me know. I&#8217;ll be glad to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She covered her eyes with her thin, beautiful hand.
&#8220;Love me&mdash;love me, Godfrey&mdash;as you used to,&#8221; she
sobbed.</p>

<p>I was dumbfounded. It seemed to me I could not
have heard aright. I stared at her until she lowered
her hand and looked at me. Then I hastily glanced
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the way I&#8217;ve acted,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;I want you to take me back. That was why I sent
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I puzzled over this. Was she still out of her mind?
Or was there some other and sane&mdash;and extremely practical&mdash;reason
behind this strange turn?&mdash;for I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
not for an instant imagine she was in sane and sober
earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;No wonder.
But it&#8217;s so, Godfrey. I want your love&mdash;I want <i>you</i>.
Won&#8217;t you&mdash;won&#8217;t you&mdash;take me&mdash;back?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice sounded pitifully sick and weak; and when
I looked at her I could not but see that to refuse to
humor her would be to endanger her life. I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Edna, this is an utter surprise for me&mdash;about the
last thing I expected. I can&#8217;t grasp it&mdash;so suddenly.
I&mdash;I&mdash; Do you really mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really mean it, dear,&#8221; she said earnestly.</p>

<p>It was evident she, in her secret heart, was taking it
for granted that her news would be welcome to me;
that all she had to do in order to win me back as her
devoted, enslaved husband was to announce her willingness
to come. I have often marveled at this peculiar
vanity of women&mdash;their deep, abiding belief in the power
of their own charms&mdash;the all but impossibility of a
man&#8217;s ever convincing a woman that he does not love
her. They say hope is the hardiest of human emotions.
I doubt it. I think vanity, especially the sex vanity
both of men and of women, is far and away hardier
than even hope. I saw she was assuming I would be
delighted, deeply grateful, ardently responsive as soon
as I should grasp the dazzling glad tidings. And she
so ill and weak that I dared not speak at all frankly
to her.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand for mine. I slowly took
it, held it listlessly. I did not know what to do&mdash;what
to say.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>&#8220;It is so good to have you again, dear,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to kiss me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; I muttered, dropping her
hand and standing up to gaze out over the gardens.
&#8220;I am stunned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been cruel to you,&#8221; she said with gracious
humility. &#8220;Can you ever forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to forgive. But&mdash;&#8221; There I
halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make up for it, dear,&#8221; she went on, sweetly
gracious. &#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised that you are stunned.
You didn&#8217;t realize how I loved you. I didn&#8217;t
myself. I couldn&#8217;t believe at first when I found
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not strong enough to talk about these
things to-day,&#8221; said I. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait until&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She interrupted my hesitating speech with a laugh
full of gentle gayety. &#8220;You&#8217;re quite wrong,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not out of my mind. I mean it, dear&mdash;and more.
Oh, we shall be <i>so</i> happy! You&#8217;ve been far too modest
about yourself. You don&#8217;t appreciate what a fascinating
man you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I reddened violently. I sat, rose, sat again.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me the shock of my life,&#8221; said I, with
an embarrassed laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to think this over.&#8221;
I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;don&#8217;t go yet,&#8221; said she, with the graciousness
of a princess granting a longer interview. &#8220;Let
me tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;You must be careful.
You mustn&#8217;t overtax yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>&#8220;Oh, but <i>this</i> does me good. Sit near me, Godfrey,
and hold my hand while I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt like one closeted with an insane person and
compelled to humor his caprices. I obediently shifted
to a seat near her and took her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could never guess how it came about,&#8221; she
went on.</p>

<p>As she was looking inquiringly at me, I said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very strange. For the first few weeks after
the divorce&mdash;no, not the divorce&mdash;but the decree&mdash;for
it isn&#8217;t a divorce yet, thank God!&mdash;for the first weeks
I was happy&mdash;or thought I was. I went early and late.
I had never been so gay. I acted like a girl just
launched in society. I was in ecstasies over my freedom.
Do you mind, dear? Does it hurt you for me
to say these things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How queer you are! But I suppose you are dazed,
poor dear. Never mind! When I am better&mdash;stronger,
I&#8217;ll soon convince you.&#8221; And she nodded and smiled
at me. &#8220;Poor dear! How cruel I have been!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;we&#8217;ll wait till you are stronger,&#8221; stammered
I, making a move to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must tell you how it came about,&#8221; she said,
detaining me. &#8220;All of a sudden&mdash;when I was at my
gayest&mdash;I began to feel strange and sad&mdash;to dislike
everyone and everything about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the illness working in you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She gave the smile of gentle tolerance with which
she received my attempts at humor when she was in an
amiable mood. &#8220;How like you that is! But it wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
the illness at all. It was my inmost heart striving to
force open its door and reveal its secret. Do be a little
romantic, this once, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;and then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;a paragraph in one of the society papers.
Some one sent it to me anonymously. Was it you,
dear?&mdash;and did you do it to make me jealous?&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke as one who suddenly sees straight into a
secret. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said I hastily. &#8220;It never entered
my head to think you cared a rap about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t tease me, Godfrey, dear. You must
have been making all sorts of plans to win me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You read the item in the paper?&#8221; suggested I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;I must finish. I read it. And at first
I shrugged my shoulders and said to myself I didn&#8217;t
in the least care. But I couldn&#8217;t get the thing out of
mind. Godfrey, I had always been too sure of you.
You never seemed to be a single tiny bit interested in
other women. So the thought of you and another
woman had not once come to me. That item put it
there. You&mdash;<i>my</i> husband&mdash;<i>my</i> Godfrey and another
woman! It was like touching a match to powder. I
went mad. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sitting up, her eyes wild, her voice trembling.
&#8220;You must not excite yourself, Edna,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went mad,&#8221; she repeated, so interested in her
emotions that she probably did not hear me. &#8220;I rushed
down to Margot. I fell ill. I made her telegraph for
you. Oh, how I suffered until I knew you were here.
If you hadn&#8217;t come right away I&#8217;d have cabled to my
lawyer in New York to have the divorce set aside&mdash;or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
whatever they do. I can have it set aside any time up
to the end of the six months, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted I, though her tone of positive
knowledge made my reply superfluous.</p>

<p>She seemed instinctively to feel a suspicion&mdash;an
explanation of her amazing about-face&mdash;that was slowly
gathering in my bewildered mind. She drew from the
folds of her negligee a note and handed it to me. She
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t confessed the worst I had done. Read
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wish you to know,&#8221; insisted she. &#8220;There
mustn&#8217;t be anything dark between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I reluctantly opened the note and read. It was
from Prince Frascatoni&mdash;not the cold bid for a break
that my suspicion expected but a passionate appeal to
her not to break their engagement and throw him over.
I could by no reach of the imagination picture that
calm, weary-eyed man of the world writing those lines&mdash;which
shows how ill men understand each other where
women are concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sent me that note the day I came here,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;I did not answer it.&#8221; Her tone was supreme
indifference&mdash;the peculiar cruelty of woman toward
man when she does not care.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were engaged to him?&#8221; said I&mdash;because I
could think of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she. Then with the chaste pride of
the &#8220;good&#8221; woman, &#8220;But not until after the decree
was granted. He would have declared himself in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
York, but I wouldn&#8217;t permit <i>that</i>. At least, Godfrey,
I never forgot with other men that I was your wife&mdash;or
let them forget it. You believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She gazed dreamily into vacancy. &#8220;To think,&#8221; she
mused, &#8220;that I imagined I could marry him&mdash;<i>any</i> man!
How little a woman knows her own heart. I always loved
you. Godfrey, I don&#8217;t believe there is any such thing
as divorce&mdash;not for a good woman. When she gives
herself&#8221;&mdash;in a dreamy, musical voice, with a tender
pressure of my hand&mdash;&#8220;it is for time and for eternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never in all my life had I so welcomed anyone as I
welcomed the interrupting nurse. I felt during the
whole interview that I was under a strain; until I was
in the open air and alone I did not realize how terrific
the strain. I walked&mdash;on and on, like a madman&mdash;vaulting
gates and fences, scrambling over hedges, plowing
through gardens, leaping brooks&mdash;on and on, hour
after hour. What should I do? What <i>could</i> I do?
Nothing but wait until she was out of danger, wait and
study away at this incredible, impossible freak of hers&mdash;try
to fathom it, if it was not the vagary of a diseased
mind. I wished to believe it that, but I could not.
There was nothing of insanity in her manner, and from
beginning to end her story was coherent and plausible.
Plausible, but not believable; for I had no more vanity
about her loving me than has the next man when he
does not want the love offered him and finds it inconvenient
to credit, and so is in the frame of mind to see
calmly and clearly.</p>

<p>I wandered so far that I had to hire a conveyance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
some village at which I halted toward nightfall. As
soon as I was at the house I ordered my valet to pack,
and wrote Edna a note saying that neglected business
compelled me to bolt for London. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll be back,&#8221; I
wrote, at the command of human decency. &#8220;I feel that
I can go, as you are almost well.&#8221; Half an hour later
I was in the train for London.</p>

<p>A letter, feebly scrawled, came from her the next day
but one&mdash;a brief loving note, saying that she understood
and that I knew how eagerly she was looking forward
to my return&mdash;&#8220;but don&#8217;t worry, dearest, about me. I
shall soon be well, now that my conscience is clear and
all is peace and love between us. I know how you hate
to write letters, but you will telegraph me every day.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How I got through those next few weeks I cannot
tell. I had no sense of the reality of the world about me
or of my own thoughts and actions. Every once in a
while&mdash;sometimes when I was talking with the men whose
company I sought, again when I was alone in bed and
would start abruptly from sleep&mdash;I pinched myself or
struck myself violently to see if I was awake. Edna&#8217;s
letters were daily and long. I read them, stared at them,
felt less certain than ever of my sanity or of my being
awake. I sent her an occasional telegram, dictated to
Rossiter&mdash;a vague sentence of congratulation on her
better health or something of that kind. Soon this formality
degenerated to a request to Rossiter: &#8220;And telegraph
Mrs. Loring.&#8221; Or he would say, &#8220;Shall I send
Mrs. Loring a telegram?&#8221; and I would reply, &#8220;Yes&mdash;do
please.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>It was obviously necessary that I should not see her
before she was well enough to be talked to frankly. I
invented excuses for staying away until my ability in
that direction gave out. Then Rossiter, best of secretaries,
divining my plight, came to the rescue. I gave
him a free hand. He went too far, created in her predisposed
mind the illusion that I was champing with impatience
at the business that persisted in keeping me
away from her. I do not blame him; he took the only
possible course.</p>

<p>At last she was completely restored. The doctors
and nurses could find no pretext for lingering, and that
in itself was proof positive of her health and strength.
She was having her meals with the family, was attending
to her correspondence, was alarmed because she was taking
on flesh so rapidly. She began offering to join me
in London. When she wrote that she was starting the
next day I telegraphed her not to come; and, after four
more days of delay on various excuses, I went down. I
should have liked to postpone this interview a week or
ten days. Again I see you smiling at me, posing as
madly in love with Mary Kirkwood yet able to put off
the joy of being free to go to her. But, gentle reader,
you must not forget that I had first to deal with Edna.
And, from what you have learned of her, do you think
I was wise or foolish to wish to meet her only when she
could not possibly prevent candor by pleading a remnant
of invalidism?</p>

<p>She was charmingly dressed to receive me, rushed
forward before them all and flung her arms around my
neck in a graceful, effusive fashion she had learned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
the Continent. I received the shock as calmly as I could,
noting the awkwardly concealed surprise of Margot and
Hugh. We had lunch; she did most of the talking&mdash;a
gay, happy-hearted rattling&mdash;the natural expression of
a woman with not a care in the world. And I&mdash; In
spite of myself I felt like an executioner come to assassinate
an unsuspicious and innocent victim. For the
best side of her was to the fore, and all the unpleasant
traits were so thoroughly concealed that they seemed to
have been burned up in that terrible fever. I <i>knew</i>
they were still there, but I could not <i>feel</i> it.</p>

<p>When we were alone in her sitting room, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your valet and your luggage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In London,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re coming on a later train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I, seizing this excellent opportunity.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going back this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a cry of dismay. &#8220;Godfrey!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a shame!&#8221; Then, rushing to the
bell, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have my things got ready. I&#8217;ll go back with
you. You shan&#8217;t be left alone, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>I seated myself. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ring,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Wait till
we&#8217;ve talked the matter over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you can&#8217;t really believe&mdash;even yet,&#8221; cried
she laughingly. &#8220;I must convince you.&#8221; And she rang
the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;When your maid comes, send her away,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t order her to pack. You can&#8217;t go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me anxiously. &#8220;How solemn you
are!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Has something gone wrong in that
business?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said I. The maid came, was sent away.
Edna moved toward me, would have sat in my lap or on
the arm of my chair had I not prevented her by rising
on the pretext of lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very&mdash;very&mdash;strange,&#8221; said she. Then advancing
toward me and gazing into my face, &#8220;Godfrey,
there wasn&#8217;t any truth in that item&mdash;was there?&#8221; She
looked like a sweet, lovely slip of a girl, all tenderness
and sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to discuss our affairs&mdash;not malicious
newspaper gossip,&#8221; said I, fighting for my usual manner
of good-humored raillery. &#8220;First, tell me what is
the meaning of this outburst of affection for me? Aren&#8217;t
you satisfied with the settlements?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Godfrey, what a cynic you are!&#8221; laughed she.
Then with an air of earnestness that certainly was convincing,
she said: &#8220;Can&#8217;t you <i>feel</i> that I love you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; replied I blandly. &#8220;On the contrary, I
<i>know</i> that you care nothing about me. So let&#8217;s talk business
as we always have.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not rave and vow and swear. She did not
show the least excitement. She seated herself and, fixing
upon me a look which I can only describe as tenacious,
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether you believe me or not, I love you. And I
shall not give you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>My internal agitation instantly cleared away. I
am always nervous about crossing a bridge until my foot
touches it; thenceforth I am too busy crossing to bother
about myself. &#8220;Well&mdash;what do you propose?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be your wife,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;To show you how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
sorry I am for the way I have acted, to show you by
thinking only of making you happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? And what will you <i>do</i> to make me
happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look after your comfort&mdash;your home, Godfrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know about that sort of thing,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;You know only how to make a house attractive
to other people. You are far too fine for a private
housekeeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall learn,&#8221; said she sweetly. &#8220;Those things
are not difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled at this unconscious confession of incapacity
to learn the most difficult of all the arts.
&#8220;You will practice on me, eh? Thank you&mdash;but no.
You wouldn&#8217;t make me comfortable. You&#8217;d only
harass yourself and deprive me of comfort&mdash;and for
years. &#8216;Those things&#8217; are less easy than you imagine.
You are set in your ways, I in mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize,&#8221; protested she confidently.
&#8220;You must be lonely, Godfrey. You need companionship&mdash;sympathy.
I can give it to you now&mdash;for, I am
awake at last. I know my own mind and heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;That sounds well, but what
does it <i>mean</i>? Next door to nothing, my friend. You
and I are not interested in the same things. We&#8217;ve
nothing to talk about. I don&#8217;t know the things you
know&mdash;the social, the fashionable side of life. You
don&#8217;t know my side of life&mdash;and you couldn&#8217;t and
wouldn&#8217;t learn enough to interest me. Any forced interest
you might give would bore me. Pardon my
frankness, but this is no time for polite falsehoods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
The fact is we&#8217;ve outgrown each other. When we look
out of our eyes, each of us sees an entirely different
world; and neither of us cares about or even believes in
the other&#8217;s world. We talk, only to irritate. We are
absolutely and finally apart. It would be impossible
for us to live together.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited until I finished. I doubt if she listened.
It was her habit not to listen to what she did not wish
to hear. &#8220;Godfrey&mdash;Godfrey!&#8221; she cried, battling
with the sobs that rose, perhaps in spite of her. &#8220;Do
I mean nothing to you&mdash;I who have been everything to
you? Does the word wife mean nothing to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean nothing to me,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;And I
mean nothing to you. Let us not pretend to deceive
ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you did care about me once,&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;I am not old and faded. I still have all the charms
I used to have&mdash;yes, and more. Isn&#8217;t that so, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are more beautiful than you ever were,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;But&mdash;you&#8217;ve gotten me out of the habit of you.
And I couldn&#8217;t go back to it if I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands and wept.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your old tricks,&#8221; said I impatiently. &#8220;It has
always been your way to try to make me seem in the
wrong. As a matter of fact, you lost years ago&mdash;lost
before I did&mdash;all interest and taste for our life together.
It was you who ended our married life, not I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was all my fault,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;Forgive
me, dear. Take me back. Don&#8217;t cast me off. I&#8217;ll be
whatever you say&mdash;do whatever you wish. Only take
me back!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>I could not make an inch of progress toward the
real motive behind this obviously sincere plea. As I
sat silent, looking at her and puzzling, she began to
hope that she had moved me. No&mdash;rather, she began
to feel stronger in her deep rooted conviction that at
bottom I loved her and had never wavered. She came
across the room, dropped to her knees beside my chair
and hid her face in my lap. Why is it that passion
once extinguished can never light again? As she knelt
there I appreciated all her physical charms; but I was
appreciative with that critical calmness which is the
absence of all feeling. I laid my hand on hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edna,&#8221; I said, &#8220;what <i>is</i> the meaning of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am telling you the truth, Godfrey,&#8221; replied she,
lifting her gold-brown eyes to gaze at me. &#8220;As God
is my judge, I am telling you the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you think you are,&#8221; said I diplomatically.
&#8220;But your good sense must tell you that
there&#8217;s something wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;with you,&#8221; was her answer in a sad tone.
&#8220;I hoped we could begin to be happy at once. I see
now that I&#8217;ve got to win you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>I concealed my panic behind an amused laugh. &#8220;I
suppose I&#8217;ve misled you into forming this poor estimate
of my intelligence where you are concerned,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;You have thought all these years that, because I said
nothing, I did not understand. The truth is, for many
years I have understood you thoroughly, Edna. You
doubt it. You say to yourself, &#8216;If he had understood,
he would have been furious and would not have allowed
me to use him as a mere pocketbook.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>Up she started, wounded to the quick. &#8220;Godfrey!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;How you hurt! Oh, my dear&mdash;spare
me. If you had such a low opinion of me, don&#8217;t
tell me about it. Perhaps I deserve your contempt.
God knows, I thought I was doing right. Don&#8217;t be
harsh with me, dearest. I am only a woman, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head smilingly. &#8220;Drop it,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;You are entirely too strong a person to be able to
hide behind a plea of weakness. I have let you use me
for your own selfish pleasure all these years because I
did not especially care. Also, it kept you away from
me&mdash;which was highly agreeable to us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anguish in her eyes, whether it was genuine
or not, looked so sincere that I avoided her gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;I&#8217;m no longer in the mood to
be used. You got through with me, as you thought,
and divorced me and prepared to marry a man more
to your liking&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Godfrey&mdash;you needn&#8217;t be jealous of him&mdash;of anyone!&#8221;</p>

<p>I made a gesture of resigned despair. Jealous!
Her vanity rampant. It had seized upon an insignificant
phrase and had found what it was eagerly looking
for. &#8220;I am not jealous of him,&#8221; said I, &#8220;though it
would be useless for me to try to convince you. Still,
I repeat&mdash;I am not jealous. I was merely saying that
you have cast me off, that I choose to regard your
action as final, that I shall not let you fasten on me
again simply because your selfishness and vanity happen
to discover a new value in me. Do I make my position
clear?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>&#8220;I see I can&#8217;t convince you of what&#8217;s in my heart,&#8221;
said she with sweet resignation. &#8220;I had no right to
expect it&mdash;to hope for it. But my life will convince
you, Godfrey. I shall win you back!&#8221;</p>

<p>I retained my appearance of calmness. But I was
the reverse of calm. I appreciated that she had me
in her power. So far as I could judge, she was not
after more money, but was under the spell of some form
of hysteria that gave her the delusion of an actual desire
to love me and to be loved by me. As she had a
fortune in her own right, and a large one, I was without
means of controlling her. I could not compel her
to stick to her bargain and make the divorce legally
final; and, even if I had been so disposed I had no
ground for a divorce from her unless she should be
consenting and assisting.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you cared for another woman, I might despair,&#8221;
she went on. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t. My heart tells
me that you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Should I tell her? I strangled the impulse as it
was born; my common sense lost no time in reminding
me of the folly of that course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be so utterly yours, Godfrey,&#8221; she went on,
&#8220;that you&#8217;ll simply <i>have</i> to love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have no more of this nonsense,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Understand, once for all, Edna, the day
when you can use me is past&mdash;gone forever. You are
free&mdash;and so am I. We will annoy each other no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She faced me, her bosom heaving, her widening eyes
scrutinizing me. And what I saw in them made me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
quail. For there shone the arch-fiend jealousy. &#8220;Godfrey!&#8221;
she exclaimed at last. &#8220;It must be another
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed&mdash;not pleasantly, I imagine. &#8220;Is there no
end to your vanity?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another woman,&#8221; she repeated dazedly. &#8220;If that
weren&#8217;t true you couldn&#8217;t treat me harshly&mdash;you would
want me back&mdash;would love me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there were not another woman on earth, I would
not go back to you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>But what woman would believe that of a man&mdash;especially
of one upon whom she had put her private brand?
She said in the same slow ferocious way: &#8220;Some woman
has hold of you&mdash;is getting ready to make a fool of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed&mdash;nervously watching her mind dart from
woman to woman of those we knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;you can&#8217;t deceive me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Mary
Kirkwood! She has been stealing you away from me.
And you, a fool like all men where women are concerned,
can&#8217;t see through her.&#8221; Edna laughed wildly. &#8220;But
she has <i>me</i> to reckon with now. I&#8217;ll show her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Kirkwood is engaged to Hartley Beechman,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nobody of a novelist,&#8221; said Edna. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
mere blind. She&#8217;s after <i>you</i>. After <i>my</i> husband&mdash;the
man <i>I</i> love! We&#8217;ll see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I laughed&mdash;and I am sure my counterfeit of
indifference was successful. &#8220;Have it your way,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;But the fact remains that you and I are done with each
other.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>&#8220;I shall set aside the divorce,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; replied I, lighting a cigarette and
preparing to leave the room. &#8220;If you are not content
with the terms of settlement you can have more money.
If that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>do</i> I love you?&#8221; cried she, all softness and
piteous appeal again. &#8220;You who are so base that you
think only of money! What weakness for me to love
you! Yet, God help me, I do&mdash;I do! Godfrey&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to London,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She stretched out her arms, and her face was a grief-stricken
appeal for mercy. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be so cruel to
me&mdash;your Edna.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled mockingly at her and left the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> not been unaware of your anger and disgust
with me, gentle reader, during the progress of the preceding
scene. In real life&mdash;in your own life&mdash;you would
have understood such a scene. But you are not in the
habit of reading realities in books&mdash;real men, real women,
real action. Everything is there toned down, put in
what is called an artistic perspective. Well, I am not
an artist, and perhaps I have no right to express an
opinion upon matters of art. But I&#8217;ll venture. To me
art means a point of view upon life; so, I see nothing
artistic, nothing but more or less grotesque nonsense, in
an art that is not a point of view but a false view. But
to keep to Edna and myself.</p>

<p>You think I should have been moist and mushy,
should have taken her back, should have burdened myself
for the rest of my days with her insincere and unsympathetic
personality. You are saying: &#8220;But after all
she loved him.&#8221; Even so&mdash;what does the word love mean
when used by a person of her character? It means nothing
but the narrowest, blighting selfishness. She had
for years used me without any thought for or of my
feelings, wishes, needs. When we moved into our grand
New York house she gave me as a bedroom the noisiest
room in the house, one overlooking the street where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
rattling of carriages, cabs, and carts and the talk and
laughter of pedestrians kept me awake until far into the
night and roused me about four in the morning&mdash;this,
when I was working with might and main all day long
and needed every moment of rest I could get. Why did
she give me that room? Because she wanted the only
available quiet room&mdash;beside her own bedroom&mdash;for a
dressing room! She said the light in the room she gave
me was unfit to dress by! I thought nothing of all this
at the time. It is characteristic of American wives to
do these things; it is characteristic of American men to
regard them as the matter of course. I cite the small
but not insignificant incident to show the minuteness of
her indifference to me. I have already given many of
the larger though perhaps less important instances, and
I could give scores, hundreds, in the same tenor. She
professed to love me at that time&mdash;and she either had or
simulated a very ardent passion. But that was not love,
was it? Love is generous, is considerate, finds its highest
pleasure of self-gratification in making the loved one
happy. Such a conception of love never entered her head&mdash;and
how many American women&#8217;s heads does it enter?
How it amuses me to watch them as they absorb everything,
give nothing, sit enthroned upon their vanities&mdash;and
then wonder and grow sulky or sour when their husbands
or lovers tire of the thankless task of loving them
and turn away&mdash;or turn them away.</p>

<p>If Edna had awakened to genuine love, gentle outraged
reader, would she not have been overwhelmed with
shame as she looked back upon her married life? Would
she have come to me with the offer of her love as a queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
with the offer of her crown? She would not have indulged
in empty words; she would have tried to <i>do</i> something
by way of reparation. She would not have demanded
that she be taken back; but, feeling that she
had forfeited her rights, she would have tried to find
out whether I would consent to take her back; and if she
had found that I would not, she would have accepted her
fate as her desert.</p>

<p>In those circumstances do you think I could have
laughed at her and remained firm? No one not a monster
could have done that.</p>

<p>But the thing she called love was not love at all,
was merely as I described it to her&mdash;a newly discovered
way of using me after she had thought all possible use
for me exhausted. Such, gentle reader, is the simple
truth. Yet because I had intelligence enough to see the
truth and firmness enough not to be swayed by shallow
and meaningless sentimentalities, you call me hard, harsh,
cruel. One of your impulsive kindly souls would have
taken her weeping to his arms, would have begun to live
with her. And there the novel would have ended, with
you, gentle reader, all tears and thrills. For, having no
imagination, you would have been unable to picture the
few weeks of cat-and-dog life after the &#8220;happy ending,&#8221;
then the breaking apart in hatred and vindictiveness.
But this is not an &#8220;artistic&#8221; novel. It is a story
of life, a plain setting forth of actualities, in the hope
that it may enable some men and women to understand
life more clearly and to live their own lives more wisely
and perhaps less mischievously.</p>

<p>I went to my daughter. &#8220;Margot,&#8221; said I, &#8220;your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
mother threatens to try to stop the divorce. It is best
for both her and me that we be free. I am determined
not to live with her again, for I abominate the sort of
life she and you lead. If you will do what you can to
bring her to her senses, I will see that you don&#8217;t regret
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot rather liked me, I believe. Not as a father;
as a father I made her ashamed, like everything else
American about her. But it was a resigned kind of
shame, and she appreciated my money, my good nature
about it and my services in bringing back her marquis
and making possible her son the earl. I knew I could
count on her active sympathy; for she would vastly prefer
that her mother be the Princess Frascatoni.</p>

<p>My mother, Mrs. Loring; my mother, the Princess
Frascatoni. Pronounce those two phrases, gentle reader,
and you will grasp my meaning.</p>

<p>I was by no means sure she would have any influence
with her mother, even though she was now the wife of
one marquis and the mother of a marquis to be, with
about half the high British peerage as relatives. But I
was desperate, and a desperate man clutches at anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are right, papa,&#8221; said she in her mother&#8217;s
own grave sweet way. &#8220;You and mamma never
have been suited to each other. Besides, I don&#8217;t want her
away off in America where I never expect to be again.
Some of the girls who have married here like to go back
there and receive the flattery and the homage. But it
seems cheap to me. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t care what the
Americans think of me. I&#8217;m not snobbish, as I used
to be. I am English now&mdash;loyal English to the core.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>&#8220;This is the place for your mother, too.&#8221; An idea
occurred to me. &#8220;If I took your mother back with
me, I would have my parents and hers live with us in a
big place I&#8217;m going to buy in the country. You don&#8217;t
know your grandparents well?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was coloring deeply. She must have heard more
than her mother dreamed she knew. &#8220;No, papa,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother and I were disgracefully neglectful
of them,&#8221; pursued I. &#8220;But I shall make up for it, as
far as I can. I wish you would come over and visit us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like it, papa,&#8221; murmured she, ready to
sink down with shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are plain people,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;but they are
good and honest&mdash;much ahead of these wretched parasites
you&#8217;ve been brought up among.... Talk to your
mother about them. Tell her what I have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>She understood thoroughly; that is the sort of thing
fashionable people always understand. &#8220;I shall, papa,&#8221;
said she. And I could see her putting on a fetching air
of sweet innocence and telling her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if she does not like it,&#8221; continued I&mdash;&#8220;can&#8217;t
bear the scandal and ridicule among her fashionable
friends&mdash;why, she can desert me. And that would give
me ground for divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would be dreadfully unhappy over there,&#8221; said
Margot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; said I, and my accent was a guarantee.</p>

<p>Should I see Edna again and picture our life together
in the house of love she was bent upon? I decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
against it. Margot&#8217;s pictures might lack the
energy and detail of mine. They would more than make
up in bringing home to her the awful reality, as she
would believe Margot where she might suspect me of
merely threatening what I would never carry out. So,
off I went to London&mdash;to wait.</p>

<p>About the hardest task in this world is inaction
when every fiber of your being is clamorous for action.
Yet I contrived to sit tight&mdash;for a week&mdash;for two weeks.
I have always regarded myself as too impatient, too
impetuous. And, beyond question, my natural tendency
is to the precipitate. But looking back over my life I
am astonished&mdash;and not a little pleased with myself&mdash;as
I note how I have held myself in check, have confined
my follies of rash haste to occasions when miscarriage
was not a serious matter.</p>

<p>Armitage came&mdash;on the way from St. Moritz to
America. As soon as I could command the right tone,
I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen your sister and Mrs. Armstrong? How
are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied he indifferently. &#8220;Motoring in
Spain at present, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beechman&mdash;he&#8217;s with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He&#8217;s somewhere hereabouts, I believe. I saw
him in Hyde Park the other day&mdash;looking as seedy as if
he were pulling out of an illness. I spoke and he stared
and scowled and nodded&mdash;like the bounder that he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care for him?&#8221; said I, rejoiced by this
news of my rival&#8217;s seediness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, one doesn&#8217;t bother to like or dislike that sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
of chap.&#8221; He said this in a supercilious manner&mdash;a manner
he had never had in the earlier period of our acquaintance.
How the inner man does poke through the
surface when the veneer of youth wears thin!</p>

<p>&#8220;For one who despises birth and wealth and rank,&#8221;
said I, not without a certain malice, &#8220;you have a queer
way of talking at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armitage winced, changed the subject by saying:
&#8220;And what the devil&#8217;s the matter with <i>you</i>? You&#8217;re
looking anything but fit yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I&#8217;m up against it, as usual,&#8221; said I gloomily.</p>

<p>He laughed. My pessimism was one of the jokes of
my friends. But, having seen so much of the ravages
of optimism&mdash;of the cheer-boys-cheer and always-look-at-the-bright-side
sort of thing, I had given myself the
habit of reckoning in the possibilities of disaster at full
value when I made plans. Little people ought always to
be optimistic. Then, their enthusiasm&mdash;<i>if</i> directed by
some big person&mdash;produces good results, where they
would avail nothing could they see the dangers in advance.
But big people must not be&mdash;and are not&mdash;optimists,
whatever they may pretend. The big man must
foresee all the chances against success. Then, if his
judgment tells him there is still a chance for success, his
courage of the big man will enable him to go firmly
ahead, not blunderingly but wisely. The general must
be pessimist. The private must be optimist; for if he
were pessimist, if he saw what the general must see, he
would be paralyzed with fear and doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always grumbling,&#8221; said Armitage. &#8220;Yet
you&#8217;re the luckiest man I know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s why,&#8221; replied I.</p>

<p>He understood, nodded. &#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s luck? Nothing but shrewd calculation. The
fellow who can&#8217;t calculate soon loses any windfalls that
may happen to blunder his way. But what&#8217;s the grouch
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so helplessly befogged that I resolved to tell
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My late wife is threatening not to release me,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>He smiled curiously. &#8220;But she hasn&#8217;t done it yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;At least not up to eleven
o&#8217;clock this morning, New York time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she will,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t let her, for one reason,&#8221; replied he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as fond of your freedom as I am. And nothing
on earth could induce me to marry again. When
women&mdash;English women&mdash;look at me I see them fairly
twitching to get me where they can make free use of
me. Yes&mdash;marriage has gone the way of everything
else. Business&mdash;finance&mdash;politics&mdash;religion&mdash;they&#8217;ve all
degenerated into so many means of graft. And art&#8217;s
going the same way. And marriage&mdash;it&#8217;s the woman&#8217;s
great and only graft. Our women look at marriage in
two ways&mdash;how much can be got out of it, living with
the man; how much will it net as alimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seemed rather positive that my late wife
would not hold on to me?&#8221; persisted I.</p>

<p>He eyed me sharply. &#8220;You really wish to be
free?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>&#8220;I am determined to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a charming&mdash;a lovely woman,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>There was doubt of my candor in his eyes. It is
all but impossible for a man rightly to judge any
woman except her he has tired of or for some other
reason does not want and cannot imagine himself wanting.
The unpossessed woman has but the one value;
the possessed woman must have other values&mdash;or she has
none. Armitage could judge Edna only as female,
unpossessed female. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a charming&mdash;a lovely woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the former Mrs. Armitage,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So&mdash;so,&#8221; conceded he. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve always believed
you were a fond husband at bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dismiss it from your mind,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You are
hesitating about telling me something. Say it!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a certain nervousness he yielded to his love
of gossip. &#8220;Prince Frascatoni&mdash;you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>I beamed in a reassuring smile. &#8220;My late wife&#8217;s
chief admirer,&#8221; said I. &#8220;A fine fellow. I like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s visiting down at&mdash;what&#8217;s the name of the
place your son-in-law has taken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is?&#8221; exclaimed I jubilantly. &#8220;When did he
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About a week, I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks encouraging, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; cried I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly does,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They say he was
charging round town like a lunatic up to a few weeks
ago&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two weeks ago,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now he has calmed again&mdash;looks serene. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
had a note from him this morning. I&#8217;m positive he&#8217;s
content with the way the cards are falling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change in me was so radical that Armitage
must have been convinced&mdash;for the moment. &#8220;If I
only knew!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find out for you,&#8221; suggested he. &#8220;Your
daughter has asked me down for the week end. I&#8217;ll
sacrifice myself, if you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your going as a special favor,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;these Anglo-American
menages interest me. American women are so brash with
the men of their own country. I like to see them playing
the part of meek upper servants. The only kind
of wife to have is a grateful one. To get a grateful
wife an American has to marry some poor creature,
homely, neglected by everyone till he came along. Even
then the odds are two to one she&#8217;ll go crazy about herself
and despise him&mdash;because he stooped to her, if she
can&#8217;t find any other excuse. But a titled foreigner&mdash; An
American girl is on her knees at once and stays
there. He can abuse her&mdash;step on her&mdash;kill her almost&mdash;neglect
her&mdash;waste her money. She is still humbly
grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worms have been known to turn,&#8221; protested I.
For, while I could not deny the general truth of Armitage&#8217;s
attack I felt he was whipped too far by bitterness
that he, for lack of a title, could not command what
these inferior men with titles had offered to them without
the bother of asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a worm,&#8221; declared he. &#8220;No American woman
ever divorced a title unless she was either in terror of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
her life or in terror of being robbed to the last penny
and kicked out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God all our women aren&#8217;t title crazy,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know they aren&#8217;t?&#8221; retorted he.
&#8220;Do you know one who has been tempted and has
resisted?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to confess I did not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you thanked God too soon. The truth is our
women are brought up to be snobs, spenders&mdash;useless,
vain parasites. Their systems are all ready to be infected
with the title mania.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armitage, on his favorite subject, talked and talked.
I did not listen attentively&mdash;not so much because I did
not like what he was saying or because I thought him
prejudiced as because I knew him to be a secret snob
of the thoroughgoing variety. I suspected that if
things were reversed, if he could get a title by marriage
and a position that would enable him to swagger
and would make everyone bow and scrape, he would
put the eagerest of the female title-hunters to the blush.
It may be just and proper to criticise women for being
what they are. But let us also hear in mind that it is
not their fault but the fault of their training; also that
the men do no better when they have the chance to
live in idle vanity upon the labors of some one else.</p>

<p>On the following Monday my emissary returned
from Garton Hall full to the brim with news.</p>

<p>But first he had again to assure himself that there
was no pretense in my seeming anxiety to be free. I
saw doubt of me in his eyes before he began his adroit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
cross-examination. I gave no sign that I knew what he
was about; for in those cases the one chance of convincing
is to submit to whatever tests may be applied.
It was not unnatural that he should doubt, coming as
he did direct from seeing and talking with the charming
Edna. Men are habitually fools about women&mdash;not
because women make fools of them but because they
enjoy the sensation of making fools of themselves.
That is a sensation much praised by poets, romancers,
sentimentalists of all kinds; and because of this praise
it has come to have a certain fictitious value, has come
to be a cheap way for a man to imagine himself a devil
of a fellow, a figure of romantic recklessness. There is
no limit to which the passion for living up to a pose
will not carry a man. Men have flung away their
fortunes, their lives, for the sake of a pose; martyrs
have burned at the stake for pose. So a man of experience
even more than your ordinary brick-brained
citizen is distrustful of his fellow men where women are
concerned. And it is nothing against Armitage&#8217;s intelligence,
nor any sign of his having a low estimate
of my strength of mind, that he tried to make absolutely
sure of me before proceeding.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was Edna&#8217;s charm. Women&mdash;I
mean, our fashionable and would-be fashionable American
women of all classes, from Fifth Avenue to the
Bowery, from Maine to the Pacific&mdash;women are parlor-bred&mdash;are
bred to make an imposing surface impression.
The best of them fool the most expert man, as Edna
had been fooling Armitage during those two days down
in the country. A man has to live with them to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
them out. And often, our men, being extremely busy
and kindly disposed toward their women and unobservant
of them and uncritical of them, do not find them
out for many years. The house is run badly, the money
is wasted, the children are not brought up right. But
the man lets it pass as &#8220;part of the game.&#8221; He tells
himself that not much but good looks is to be expected
of a woman; he buries himself still deeper in his business.
Then&mdash; If he is a successful man, along about
forty when he has got up high enough to be able to
relax from the labor of his career and thinks of enjoying
himself, he tries to form an alliance for pleasure
with his wife. And lo and behold, he discovers that he
is married to a vain, superficial fool.</p>

<p>There could have been no more delightful experience
than passing a few days in the society of Edna.
She had educated herself, admirably, thoroughly, for
show. She could have fooled the fashionable man his
whole life through, for one cannot see beyond the range
of his own vision. She might have fooled many a serious
man of the narrow type; an excellent shoemaker
might easily be misled by a clever showy jack of all
trades into thinking him a master of all trades so long
as he avoided betraying his ignorance of shoemaking.
But your successful American man of the highest type,
having a broad range of practical interests, becomes a
shrewd judge of human values. Thus, the American
woman who can pass for brilliant in fashionable society
at home or abroad cannot deceive the American man&mdash;for
long. Not when he lives with her. No wonder she
finds him coarse; who does not wince when vanity is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
stepped on or ignored? No wonder she thinks him uninteresting.
A child would have an equally poor opinion
of any person inexpert at catcher, marbles, and mud
pies.</p>

<p>Armitage, in a company of titled people, his nostrils
full of his beloved, stealthily enjoyed perfumes of wealth
and rank, was captivated by Edna. If he had stopped
a week or so, his American shrewdness might have found
her out, might have seen why I could view with unruffled
sleeves, as the Chinese say, the loss of so lovely and
lively a companion. But, stopping only for the week
end, he became doubtful of my sincerity. I measured
how deeply he had been deluded when he spoke of her
keen sense of humor. Woman nature is too practical,
too matter of fact for even the cleverest of them to
have a real sense of humor&mdash;with now and then an
exception, of course. Edna had not a glimmer of appreciation
of either wit or humor. But only I, before
whom she dropped all pretenses except those that were
essential to her pose&mdash;only I knew this. Before the
rest of the world, with the aid of her vivacity!&mdash;What
an aid to women is vivacity!&mdash;how many of them it
marries well!&mdash;With the aid of her vivacity she made
a convincing show not only of appreciating humor and
wit but also of having much of both. At precisely the
right place she gave the proper, convincing, charming
exhibition of dancing eyes and pearl-white teeth. And
occasionally with a pretty liveliness she repeated as her
own some witticism she had heard much applauded in
another and remote company. But I do not blame you,
ladies, for your inveterate and incessant posing. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
men are determined to idealize and to be gulled, and
you need us to pay for your luxury and your finery.</p>

<p>I let Armitage probe on and on until my impatience
for his news would suffer no further delay. I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you refuse to be convinced. So let it go at
that, and tell me what you found out. Is she to
marry Frascatoni?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve been telling you, I believe she is in love
with you, Loring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is she going to free me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless you do something pretty soon, I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;ll lose her.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was too absurd that he, who had lived with one
of these showy vivacious women, had found her out and
had rid himself of her should be thus taken in by another
of precisely the same kind. But that&#8217;s the way
it is with men. They understand why they yawn at
their own show piece; but they can&#8217;t appreciate that all
show pieces in time produce the same effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;There still remain three weeks before the day on
which her lawyers must ask the judge to confirm the
decree,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Do you think she will have them
do it or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless you get busy, old man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall not get busy. I shall do everything
I can to encourage her to stay free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll lose her,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Frascatoni is
mad about her, and he knows how to make an impression
on a woman. It irritated me to see a damned dago
carrying off such a prize&mdash;and you know I&#8217;m not
prejudiced in favor of American women.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>&#8220;I want to see her happy,&#8221; said I. &#8220;She will be
happy with him&mdash;so, I hope he gets her.&#8221; I laughed
mockingly. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t be happy with an American,
Bob&mdash;not even with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He colored guiltily. &#8220;That idea never entered my
head,&#8221; protested he.</p>

<p>But I laughed the more. &#8220;And she wouldn&#8217;t have
you, Bob,&#8221; I went on. &#8220;So, don&#8217;t put yourself in the
way of being made uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had enjoyed himself hugely. Not only was my
former wife most entertaining, but also Margot. She
had, beyond question, been beautifully educated for
the part she was to take in life. Her manner&mdash;so Armitage
assured me&mdash;was the perfection of gracious
simplicity&mdash;the most exquisite exhibition of the perfect
lady&mdash;&#8220;note how ladylike I am, yet how I treat you as
if you were my equal.&#8221; Gracious&mdash;there&#8217;s the word
that expresses the whole thing. And she had a quantity
of bright parlor tricks&mdash;French recitation, a little
ladylike singing in a pleasant plaintive soprano that
gave people an excuse for saying: &#8220;She could have
been a grand-opera star if she had cared to go in seriously
for that sort of thing.&#8221; Also, a graceful skirt
dance and a killing cake walk. She had an effective
line of fashionable conversation, too&mdash;about books and
pictures, analysis of soul states, mystic love theories&mdash;all
the paraphernalia of a first-class heroine of a first-class
society novel. And you, gentle reader, who know
nothing, would never have dreamed that she knew nothing.
You who are futile would not have seen how
worthless she was&mdash;except to do skirt dances well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
enough for a drawing-room or to talk soul states well
enough for a society novel.</p>

<p>The more Armitage discoursed of the delights of
his little visit the more nervous I became lest Edna
should again change her mind and inflict me further.
What he had said brought back my life with her in
stinging vividness. I lived again the days of my self-deception,
the darker days of my slow awakening, the
black days of my full realization of the mess my life
was, and of my feeling that there was no escape for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will admit, Loring,&#8221; said Armitage, &#8220;that as
women go our women are the best of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I assented, sincerely. &#8220;And they ought to
be. America is the best place to grow men. Why
shouldn&#8217;t it be the best place to grow women?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not pursue the subject. In his heart he disagreed
with me, for he was wholly out of conceit with
everything American. His pose had been the other
way, and he shrank from uncovering himself.</p>

<p>A day or so later I was crossing Green Park when
I ran straight into Hartley Beechman. I smiled pleasantly,
though not too cordially. He planted himself in
front of me and stared with a tragic frown. I then
noted that he verged on the unkempt, that he had
skipped his morning shave and perhaps his bath. His
stare was unmistakably offensive&mdash;the look of a man
who is seeking a quarrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re you, Beechman?&#8221; said I, ignoring the
signs of foul weather. &#8220;Armitage told me you were
in town, but didn&#8217;t know your address. Stopping
long?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>&#8220;You are a scoundrel,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. As I was much the larger
and stronger man I could afford to do it. &#8220;So I&#8217;ve
often heard,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s true. What of
it? Why should you think I cared to know your opinion
of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I send you a challenge will you accept it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;No, I never pay the slightest attention
to crank letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a coward. You will not give me a chance
to meet you on equal terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you over my knee and give you a spanking
if you don&#8217;t behave yourself,&#8221; said I, and I pushed
him out of my path and was passing on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You took her away from me,&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;But
it will do you no good. She is laughing at us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>I strode away. I had heard enough to put me in
high good humor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the end of my wait upon the anxious seat
drew into its last week, I fell into a state of deep
depression. Too much eating and drinking was, of
course, the cause. But I had to pass the time somehow;
and what is there to do in London but eat and
drink?</p>

<p>Four days before the last, Rossiter came into my
sitting room with the news that Edna was calling.
There arose a nice question: Would I better send word
I was out or see her? Because of my knowledge of her
persistence where her interest was really engaged, I
decided to see her and have done with. So in she came,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
vivacious, radiant&mdash;dressed for a scene in which she
was to be heroine, as I saw at a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to repeat what I did
the other day,&#8221; cried she by way of beginning. &#8220;I&#8217;m
in quite another mood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was horribly ashamed and disgusted with myself
afterwards,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;You must have thought
me crazy. In fact, you did. You treated me as if I
were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit?&#8221; said I, arranging a chair for
her.</p>

<p>She smiled mischievously at me as she seated herself.
&#8220;You do know something about women,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;You put this chair so that my face would be
spared the strong light.&#8221; As she said this, she turned
into the full strength of the light a face as free as a
girl&#8217;s from wrinkles or any other sign of years. &#8220;You
certainly do know something about women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very little,&#8221; said I, for it was not a time to
pause and poke a finger into the swelling bubble of
woman&#8217;s baffling complexity and unfathomable mystery.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve come to tell me what it was you wanted the
other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. She was wearing a charming
hat&mdash;but her costumes were never indifferent and nearly
always charming&mdash;a feat the more remarkable because
she, being a timidly conventional woman, followed
the fashions and ventured cautiously and never
far in individual style. &#8220;You&#8217;re usually right, my
dear,&#8221; said she, &#8220;in your guesses at people&#8217;s underlying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
motives. But you were mistaken that time. I wanted
exactly what I said. I wanted <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible,&#8221; laughed I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it does sound so,&#8221; conceded she. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
the truth. I had a queer attack&mdash;an attack of jealousy.
I&#8217;d often heard of that sort of thing. I fancied
myself above it. Perhaps that was why I fell such a
foolish victim. But I&#8217;ve recovered completely.&#8221; And
her eyes were mocking me as if she had a secret joke
on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t last long,&#8221; said I, to be saying something.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, perhaps not,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;At any rate, as
soon as I heard of Mary Kirkwood&#8217;s engagement I was
cured&mdash;instantly cured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you she was engaged,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean that Beechman person,&#8221; scoffed
Edna. &#8220;She was simply amusing herself with him. A
woman&mdash;a woman of our world&mdash;might have an affair
with a man of that sort&mdash;as you men sometimes do with
queer women. But she wouldn&#8217;t think of <i>marrying</i> him.
Marriage is a serious matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s whole career,&#8221; pursued she. &#8220;It
means not only her position, but the position of her
children, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very serious,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I mean Mary&#8217;s engagement to Count von
Tilzer-Borgfeldt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t heard of it,&#8221; said I indifferently. There
could be nothing in such a silly story.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Bob Armitage tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But why should he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer,&#8221; mused she. &#8220;Perhaps he thought
there might be a little something in the talk about you
and Mary, and that it would be well not to stir things
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That might account for it,&#8221; I agreed.</p>

<p>She was studying me closely. &#8220;I believe you really
didn&#8217;t care about Mary,&#8221; continued she. &#8220;I confess
I was astonished when I first heard that you did.
She&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221; Edna laughed&mdash;&#8220;hardly up to <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But let&#8217;s not talk of her. I&#8217;ve forgotten all that.
I&#8217;ve come to make a last proposal to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was smiling, but I detected seriousness in her
eyes, in her unsteady upper lip, in her hands trying not
to move restlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize what a strong hold you have on
me, Godfrey. Is it love? Is it habit? I don&#8217;t know.
But I can&#8217;t shake it off. Don&#8217;t you think me strange,
talking to you in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more like a woman who isn&#8217;t attractive to
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You speak like a
woman accustomed to deal with men according to her
own good pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shrewd that is!&#8221; said she, with an admiring
glance. &#8220;How shrewd you are! That&#8217;s what I miss
in other men&mdash;in these men over here who have so much
that I admire. But they&mdash;well, they give me the feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
that they are superficial. Do you think <i>I</i> am superficial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an evasion,&#8221; laughed she. &#8220;You <i>do</i> think
so. And perhaps I am. A woman ought to be. A
man looks after the serious side of life. The woman&#8217;s
side is the lighter and graceful side&mdash;don&#8217;t you think
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds plausible,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I grow tired of superficial men. They give
me the feeling that&mdash;well, that they couldn&#8217;t be relied
on. And you are reliable, Godfrey. I feel about you
that no matter what happened you&#8217;d be equal to it.
And that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t want to give you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat with my eyes down, as if I were listening and
reflecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;ve been over here long enough to&mdash;to
broaden a little&mdash; You don&#8217;t mind my saying you&#8217;ve
broadened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fancied perhaps you might be seeing that I
wasn&#8217;t altogether wrong in my ideas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said I, as she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot was telling me about some plans you had&mdash;for
living on the other side. You weren&#8217;t in earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her gravely. &#8220;Very much in earnest,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;I shall never again, in any circumstances, live
as we used to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank back in her chair, slowly turned her parasol
round and round. &#8220;Then&mdash;it&#8217;s hopeless,&#8221; said she,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
with a sigh that was a sob also. And the look in the
eyes she lifted to mine went straight to my heart. &#8220;I
simply can&#8217;t stand America,&#8221; said she. &#8220;It reminds
me of&mdash;&#8221; She rose impatiently. &#8220;If you only knew,
Godfrey, how I <i>loathe</i> my origin&mdash;the dreadful depth
we came from&mdash;the commonness of it.&#8221; She shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Europe is the place for you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; cried she. &#8220;And we could be happy
over here&mdash;if you&#8217;d only see it in the right light. Godfrey,
I don&#8217;t want to&mdash;to change. Won&#8217;t you compromise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By conceding everything?&#8221; said I good-humoredly.
&#8220;By becoming the bedraggled tail to your gay and
giddy kite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You simply won&#8217;t reason about these things!&#8221;
exclaimed she. &#8220;Yet they say men are reasonable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Edna, I don&#8217;t ask you to make yourself
wretched for <i>my</i> sake. And I don&#8217;t purpose to be
wretched for <i>your</i> sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down again. The brightness had faded
from her. She looked older than I&#8217;d have believed she
could. &#8220;Well&mdash;I see it&#8217;s useless,&#8221; she said finally.
&#8220;And as I&#8217;ve got to stay over here, I simply must
marry again. You understand that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you care the least bit?&#8221; said she wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish me to be unhappy about it,&#8221; laughed I,
&#8220;to gratify your vanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are content with the settlements?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said she wearily.</p>

<p>No doubt you, gentle reader, are now completely won
over to her and think that the least I could in decency
have done would have been to insist on her accepting
half my fortune. I had no impulse toward that folly.
There is a kind of wife who can justly claim that she is
the equal partner in her husband&#8217;s wealth. But not the
Edna kind. I had made my fortune in spite of her.
Nor was I keen to give her any more money than I should
be compelled; why turn over wealth to her to fritter
away and to bolster the pretensions of a family of worthless
Italian aristocrats?</p>

<p>With a sudden darting look at me, she said: &#8220;You
know Frascatoni. What do you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine specimen,&#8221; said I. &#8220;A fascinating man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Fascinating enough,
I suppose. But&mdash;would you <i>trust</i> him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not,&#8221; replied I. &#8220;Nor any other man. I
have long since learned not to trust even myself. But
I&#8217;d trust him as far as the next man&mdash;as far as it&#8217;s necessary
to trust anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded in appreciation and agreement. &#8220;I believe
he genuinely cares for me,&#8221; she said, adding with a
melancholy look at me, &#8220;And it&#8217;s pleasant to be cared
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have heard,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never wanted anyone to care about you,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;You are independent of everything and
everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s safest,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She did not reply. After reflecting she burst out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>
with, &#8220;You ought to have <i>made</i> me, Godfrey&mdash;ought to
have trained me to your taste. Women have to be
<i>made</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if that had been possible in this case,&#8221; I observed,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she thought a long time; then with a sigh she
said: &#8220;But it&#8217;s too late now. You&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s too
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>It puzzled me to note how much the world had taught
her in some ways, and how little in others. But that is
a familiar puzzle&mdash;the unexpected, startling ways in
which knowledge juts out into ignorance and ignorance
closes in upon knowledge, forming a coast line between
the land of knowledge and the sea of ignorance more
jagged than that of Alaska or Norway. The result is
that each of us is a confused contention of wisdom and
folly in which the imperious instincts of elemental passions
and appetites, by their steady persistence, easily
get their way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve begun to look at these foreign men
seriously,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;to study them&mdash; It&#8217;s one
thing to size them up, as you say in America, with the
idea that they&#8217;re mere outsiders&mdash;acquaintances&mdash;social
friends. It&#8217;s very different to measure them with a view
to serious relations. I&#8217;m not altogether a fool&mdash;even
from your standpoint&mdash;am I, Godfrey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Distinctly not,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been <i>studying</i> these upper-class men
over here&mdash;I&#8217;ve changed my mind in some respects.
I&#8217;m not a child, you know. I haven&#8217;t done what I&#8217;ve
done without using some judgment of men and women.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
She flooded me with a smile of gratitude. &#8220;I owe my
judgment to you, Godfrey. You taught me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never agreed with anything I said&mdash;when I
did occasionally venture an opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because a woman disagrees and scorns&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t
follow that she isn&#8217;t convinced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed your mind about these men?&#8221;
said I, for my curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find a lack in them. You&#8217;re right to a certain
extent, Godfrey. They <i>are</i> futile&mdash;the cleverest of
them. Culture gives a great deal, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too long and involved to explain. And you
don&#8217;t believe in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But first, I&#8217;d like to
know what it is, and second, I&#8217;d like to know what it
<i>does</i>. I&#8217;ve never been able to get anything but words in
answer to either question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> see that it gives a great deal. But I must
admit that it takes away something&mdash;yes, much&mdash;strength
from the mind and softness from the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was astonished at this admission from her&mdash;at the
admission itself, at the fresh evidences of what a good
natural mind she had. But I had no desire to discuss
with her. I had long outgrown the folly of discussion
with futile people. I was tempted to air my own views
of this so-called culture&mdash;how it emasculated where it
pretended to soften; how it discovered nothing, invented
nothing, produced nothing, did not feed, or clothe, or
shelter, or in any way contribute to the sane happiness
of a human being; how it unfitted men and women for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
active life, made them pitiful spectators merely, scoffing
or smiling superciliously at the battle. But I refrained.
I knew she believed the r&ocirc;le of spectator the only one
worthy a lady or a gentleman&mdash;and certainly it is the
only one either lady or gentleman could take without
being exposed as ridiculous. I knew that her wise observations
were clever conversation merely, after the
manner of futile people&mdash;that when the time for action
came her snobbishness dominated her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish these men were not so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-for-nothing?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>She accepted the phrase, though she would have
preferred one less mercilessly truthful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t find everything in one person,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>That kind of tame generality&mdash;lack of interest thinly
veiled in a polite show of interest&mdash;kills conversation
and sets a tarrying caller to moving where dead silence
produces a nervous tendency to linger. Edna extended
her arm, resting her hand upon the crook of her parasol
in a gesture of approaching departure. Yet she seemed
loth to go. She rose, but counterbalanced with:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I suppose, that it&#8217;s likely to be Frascatoni?&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose, replied indifferently, &#8220;So I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood, smiling vaguely down at the gloved hand
on the crook of the parasol. &#8220;If I were only younger&mdash;or
more credulous,&#8221; said she. And I knew that there
was a thin, sour after-taste to the sparkling wine of the
prince&#8217;s love-making. I smiled&mdash;pleasant, noncommittal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask too much of life,&#8221; said she impatiently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it irritating that I should become critical just as
I am in a position to get everything I&#8217;ve longed for and
worked for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those moods pass,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Well&mdash;good-by.&#8221; She
put out her hand with a radiant smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not annoy
you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>My answering smile and pressure of the hand were
friendly, but cautiously so, for I felt I was still on thin
ice. I opened the door for her. We shook hands again.
Our eyes met. I think it must have given each of us a
shock to see in the other&#8217;s face the polite, distant look of
strangers parting. How easy it is for two to become
like one&mdash;and when they are, how impossible it seems
that they could ever be aliens. How easy it is for two
that are as one to become utter strangers; the sea is
wide, and its currents curve rapidly away from each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rossiter,&#8221; said I&mdash;he was at work in the anteroom,
&#8220;take Mrs. Loring to her carriage, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>So&mdash;she was gone; I was free!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> a shadow of doubt lingered. She was gone; I
was free. Her manner had been the manner of finality.
Her reluctance and her sadness were little more than
the convention of mourning which human beings feel
compelled to display on mortuary occasions of all kinds.
Beneath the crepe I saw a not discontented resignation,
a conviction of the truth that life together was impossible
for her and me.</p>

<p>My male readers&mdash;those who have a thinking apparatus
and use it&mdash;will probably wonder, as I did then,
that she had overlooked certain obvious advantages to
be gained through refusing to divorce me. She knew
me well enough to be certain I would not compel her to
go to America and live with me, but if she insisted would
let her stay in Europe or wander where she pleased.
This would have given her all the advantages of widowhood.
Free, with plenty of money, she could have led
her own life, without ever having to consult the conveniences
and caprices of a husband. It seemed to me
singularly stupid of her to resign this signal advantage,
to tie herself to a husband she could not ignore,
a husband she already saw would bore her, as poseurs
invariably bore each other&mdash;to tie herself to such a man
with no compensating advantage but a title. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
so stupid did it seem that from the moment she began
to waver about confirming the divorce I all but lost hope
of freedom.</p>

<p>My women readers will understand her. A man
cannot appreciate how hampered a woman of the lady
class is without a legitimate male attachment of some
kind&mdash;a husband, a brother, or a father in constant
attendance, ready for use the instant the need arises.
Our whole society is built upon the theory that woman
is the dependent, the appendage of man. Freedom is
impossible for a woman, except at a price almost no
woman voluntarily pays. To have any measure of
freedom a woman must bind herself to some man, and
the bondage has to be cruel indeed not to be preferable
to the so-called freedom of the unattached female. Thus
it was not altogether snobbishness, it may not have
been chiefly snobbishness, that moved Edna to transfer
herself to a husband who would be a more or less unpleasant
actuality. She had to have a man. She wished
to live abroad and to be in fashionable society. She
chose shrewdly. I imagine, from several things she
said, that she had measured Frascatoni with calm
impartiality, had discovered many serious disadvantages
in him as husband to a woman of her fondness
for her own way. But estimating the disadvantages
at their worst, the balance still tipped heavily toward
him.</p>

<p>I am glad I was not born a woman. I pity the women
of our day, bred and educated in the tastes of men, yet
compelled to be dependents, and certain of defeat in a
finish contest with man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>Though there was now no reasonable doubt of Edna&#8217;s
having the decree of divorce made final, I, through
overcaution or oversensitiveness as to Mary Kirkwood&#8217;s
rights, or what motive you please, would not let myself
leave London until a cable from my lawyers in New
York informed me that the decree had been entered
and that I was legally free. The newspapers had given
much space to our affairs. It was assumed that I had
come abroad &#8220;to make last desperate efforts to win
back the beautiful and charming wife, the favorite of
fashionable European society.&#8221; Stories had been published,
giving in minute detail accounts of the bribes I
had offered. And when the final decree was entered, my
chagrin and fury were pictured vividly.</p>

<p>I did nothing to discredit this, but, on the contrary,
helped along the campaign for the preservation of the
literary and journalistic fiction that the American woman
is a kind of divine autocrat over mankind. If I had
been so vain and so ungallant as to try to make the
public see the truth I should have failed. You can
discredit the truth to the foolish race of men; but you
cannot discredit, nor even cast a shade of doubt upon,
a generally accepted fiction of sentimentality. And of
all the sentimental fictions that everyone slobbers over,
but no one in his heart believes with the living and only
valid faith of works, the fictions about woman are the
most sacred. Further, how many men are there who believe
that a man could get enough of a physically lovely
woman, however trying she might be? Once in a while
in a novel&mdash;not often, but once in a while&mdash;there are
scenes portraying with some approach to fidelity what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
happens between a woman and a man who is of the sort
that is attractive to women. Invariably such scenes are
derided or denounced by the critics. Why? For an
obvious reason. A critic is, to put it charitably, an
average man. He has no insight; he must rely for his
knowledge of life solely upon experience. Now what is
the average man&#8217;s experience of women? He treats
them in a certain dull, conventional way, and they treat
him&mdash;as he invites and compels. So when he reads how
women act toward a man who does not leave them cold
or indifferent, who rouses in them some sensation other
than wonder whether they would be able to stomach him
as a husband, the critic scoffs and waxes wroth. The
very idea that women might be less reserved, less queenly,
less grudgingly gracious than woman has ever been
to him sends shooting pains through his vanity&mdash;and
toothache and sciatica are mild compared with the torturings
of a pain-shotten vanity.</p>

<p>Edna scored heavily in the newspapers. You would
never have suspected it was her late husband&#8217;s money
that had given her everything, that had made her
throughout; for, what had she, and what was she, except
a product of lavishly squandered money? Think about
that carefully, gentle reader, before you damn me and
commiserate her as in these pages a victim of my venomous
malice.... She was the newspaper heroine of the
hour. If she had been content with this&mdash; But I shall
not anticipate.</p>

<p>My cable message from New York came at five
o&#8217;clock. At half-past six, accompanied only by my
valet, I was journeying toward Switzerland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>Mrs. Kirkwood, I had learned from her brother, was
at Territet, at the Hotel Excelsior, with the Horace
Armstrongs. At four the following afternoon I descended
at Montreux from the Milan express; at five,
with travel stains removed, I was in the garden of the
Excelsior having tea with Mrs. Armstrong and listening
to her raptures over the Savoy Alps. Doubtless
you know Mrs. Armstrong&#8217;s (Neva Carlin&#8217;s) work.
Her portrait of Edna is famous, is one of the best examples
I know of inside-outness. Edna does not like it,
perhaps for that reason.</p>

<p>Mary and Horace Armstrong had gone up to Caux.
&#8220;But,&#8221; said Neva, &#8220;they&#8217;ll surely be back in a few
minutes. Count von Tilzer-Borgfeldt is coming at
half-past five.&#8221;</p>

<p>I instantly recognized that name as the one Edna
gave in telling me that Mary had gone shopping for
a title and had invested. I had thought Edna&#8217;s jeer
produced no effect upon me. I might have known
better. My nature has, inevitably, been made morbidly
suspicious by my business career. Also, I had found
out Robert Armitage as a well-veneered snob, and this
could not but have put me in an attitude of watchfulness
toward his sister, so like him mentally. Also my
investigations of that most important phenomenon of
American life, the American woman, had compelled me to
the conclusion that the disease of snobbishness had infected
them all, with a few doubtful exceptions. So,
without my realizing it, my mind was prepared to believe
that Mary Kirkwood was like the rest. When
Neva Armstrong pronounced the name Edna had given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>
there shot through me that horrible feeling of insufferable
heat and insufferable cold which it would be useless
to attempt to describe; for those who have felt it will understand
at once, and those who have not could not be
made to understand. And then I recalled Hartley Beechman&#8217;s
jeer, &#8220;She&#8217;s laughing at us both.&#8221; But my voice
was natural as I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tilzer-Borgfeldt. That&#8217;s the chap she&#8217;s engaged
to just now, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong, who is a loyal friend, flushed angrily.
&#8220;Mary isn&#8217;t that sort, and you know it, for
you&#8217;ve known her a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;s not engaged to him?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she is,&#8221; replied Neva. &#8220;And if you knew
him, you&#8217;d not wonder at it. I don&#8217;t like foreigners,
but if I weren&#8217;t bespoke I think I&#8217;d have to take Tilzer-Borgfeldt
if he asked me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt it&#8217;s a first-class title,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well, Godfrey Loring, that I
don&#8217;t mean the title.&#8221; She happened to glance toward
the entrance to the garden. &#8220;Here he comes now.
You&#8217;ll judge for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Advancing toward us was a big, happy blond man
of the pattern from which nine out of ten German upper-class
men are cut. He had the expression of simple, unaffected
joy natural to a big, healthy, happy blond youth
looking forward to seeing his best girl. He had youth,
good looks, unusual personal magnetism&mdash;and you will
imagine what effect this produced upon my mood. I
could not deny that Neva was right. Without a title
this man would have all the chances in his favor when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
he went courting. He had not a trace of aristocratic
futility.</p>

<p>You would have admired the frank cordiality of my
greeting. Instead of sitting down again I glanced at
my watch and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my time&#8217;s up. I shall have to go without
seeing Horace and Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll come to dinner?&#8221; said Mrs. Armstrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking the first express back to Paris,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I found a telegram waiting for me at my hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary will be disappointed,&#8221; said Neva. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
give Mrs. Loring my best?&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered that the English papers, with the news
doubtless in it, would not reach Territet until late that
evening or the following morning. But I could not well
tell her what had occurred. &#8220;Good-by,&#8221; said I, shaking
hands. &#8220;Tell them how sorry I was. I may see you
all in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>And away I went, with not an outward sign of my internal
state. In less than half an hour I was in the
Paris express.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I stopped at Paris a month. A letter came from her&mdash;a
bulky letter. I tossed it unopened into the fire. A
week, and a second letter came. It was not so bulky.
I flung it unopened into the fire. About two weeks, and
a third letter came. I got Rossiter to address an envelope
to her. I inclosed her unopened letter in the
envelope and mailed it. I was giving myself an exquisite
pleasure, the keener because it was seasoned with exquisite
pain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>All this time I had been amusing my idle days in
the usual fashion. My readers who lead quiet lives&mdash;the
women who sit thinking what they would do if only they
were men&mdash;the men who slip away occasionally for a
scampish holiday, and return to their sober routine with
the cheering impression that they have been most fearfully
and wonderfully devilish&mdash;those women and those
men will regret that I refrain from details of how I
amused myself. But to my notion I have said enough
when I have said &#8220;in the usual fashion.&#8221; It passed the
time as probably nothing else in the circumstances would
have passed such tenacious hours, every one lingering to
be counted. But I confess I have never been virtuous
enough to be especially raptured by so-called vice. No
doubt those who divide actions into good and bad, using
the good for steady diet and the bad for dessert, have
advantages in enjoyment over those who simply regard
things as interesting and uninteresting. For, curiously
enough, on that latter basis of division practically all
the things esteemed by most human beings as the delightful
but devilish dessert of life fall into the class of more
or less uninteresting. But for the stimulus of the notion
that he is doing something courageously, daringly
wicked, I doubt if any but a dull fellow would perpetrate
vice enough to lift the most easily scandalized hands in
the world. The trouble with vice is that it is so tiresome&mdash;and
so bad for the health. And most of it is so vulgar.
Drinking to excess and gambling, for instance. I
have indulged in both at times, when hard pressed for
ways to pass the time or when in those stupid moods of
obstinate unreasonableness in which a man takes a savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>
pleasure in disgusting himself with himself. Drinking
has a certain coarse appeal to the imagination&mdash;coarse
and slight but definite. But gambling is sheer
vulgarity. I have been called money-mad, because I have
made money, finding it easy and occupying to attend to
business. Yet never have I cared about money sufficiently
to take the faintest interest in the gaming table.
Gambling&mdash;all forms of it&mdash;is for those sordid creatures
who love money, and who have no intelligent appreciation
of its value. Gambling&mdash;all the vices, for that
matter&mdash;is essentially aristocratic; for, as I believe I
have explained, aristocracy analyzes into the quintessence
of vulgarity. The two incompetent classes&mdash;the
topmost and the bottommost&mdash;are steeped in vice, for
the same reason of their incompetence to think or to act.</p>

<p>A fourth letter, the bulkiest of all, came from Mary
Kirkwood. A few hours before it was delivered a telegram
came from her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A letter is on the way. Godfrey, I beg you
to read it. I love you.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>I tore up the telegram, sent back the letter without
opening it. You are denouncing me as inhuman, gentle
reader. Perhaps you are right. But permit me to point
out to you that, if I had not in my composition a vein
of iron, I should never have risen from the mosquito-haunted
flats of the Passaic. Also, gentle reader, if I
had been a man of the ordinary sort would Mary Kirkwood
have been sufficiently interested in me to send those
letters and that telegram?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>A day or so after the return of her last letter I was
seized&mdash;I can&#8217;t say why&mdash;with a longing to see my father
and mother and sister, on that lonely farm out in New
Jersey. I had never felt that desire since I first left
home, but had made my few and brief visits out of a
sense of duty&mdash;no, of shame. The thought of them gave
me no sensation of horror, as it gave Edna and her
daughter. When I remembered them it was simply as
one remembers any random fact. They did not understand me;
and in them there was nothing to understand.
We had few subjects for conversation, and those not
wildly interesting and soon exhausted. You will smile
when I say I loved them. Yet it is the truth. We do
not always love those we like to be with; we do not always
like to be with those we love.</p>

<p>There was nothing to detain me in Paris. The hours
hung like guests who do not know how to take leave. So
not many days elapsed between my seizure and my appearance
at the spacious and comfortable stone farmhouse
where the four old people were awaiting in a semi-comatose
or dozing state what they firmly believed was
a summons to a higher life. Their belief in it, like that
of most religious people, was not strong enough to make
them impatient to get it; still they believed, and found
the belief a satisfactory way of employing such small
part of their minds as remained awake.</p>

<p>I had not seen them or their place in several years, so
I was astonished by the changes. My sister Polly&mdash;a
homely old maid&mdash;and Edna&#8217;s father had some glimmerings
of enterprise. Polly took in and read several
magazines, and from them gathered odds and ends of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>
up-to-date ideas about dress, about furnishing, about
gardens. With the valuable assistance of old Weeping
Willie she had wrought a most creditable transformation.
The old people now &#8220;looked like something,&#8221; as the saying
is. And the place had a real smartness&mdash;both within
and without.</p>

<p>Polly&mdash;she was about eight years my senior, but
looked old enough to be my mother&mdash;Polly watched me
anxiously as I strolled and nosed about. My delight
filled her with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not so ashamed of us, perhaps?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never have been,&#8221; replied I. Nor did I put an
accent on the personal pronoun that would have been a
hint about somebody else&#8217;s feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you ought to have been,&#8221; said she. &#8220;We
were mighty far behind even the tail of the procession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit I like this better than the way we used
to live in Passaic. Polly, you&#8217;ve got the best there is
going. All the rest&mdash;all the luxury and other nonsense&mdash;is
nothing but a source of unhappiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer. I noted a touching sadness in
her expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t agree with me?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; replied she emphatically. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t
thinking of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have <i>you</i> got to be unhappy about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m ungrateful to you,&#8221; said she, with
quick sensitiveness. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not, Godfrey&mdash;indeed
I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ungrateful?&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done all you could&mdash;all anyone could.
And in a way I am happy. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; I urged, as she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve found out&mdash;looking back over my life&mdash;I&#8217;ve
found out that I&mdash; It seems to me I&#8217;ve got all the
<i>tools</i> of happiness, but nothing to <i>work on</i>. I keep
thinking, &#8216;How happy I could be if I only had something
to work on!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent. A shadow crept out of a black corner
of my heart and cast a somberness and a chill over me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you would,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Godfrey,
I&#8217;ve often felt sorry for you&mdash;sorrier than I do for myself.&#8221;
She laid her hand on my arm. &#8220;But you&#8217;re a
man&mdash;a handsome, attractive, <i>young</i> man. You&#8217;ll have
only yourself to blame if you waste your life as mine&#8217;s
been wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize how lucky you&#8217;ve been,&#8221; said I,
with a bitterness that surprised me. &#8220;You&#8217;ve at least
escaped marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to God I hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; cried she with an energy
that startled me. There was a fierce look of pain in her
eyes. &#8220;I thought you understood. But I see you
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Polly Ann?&#8221; said I gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The real unhappiness isn&#8217;t an unhappy marriage,&#8221;
replied she. &#8220;It&#8217;s being not married at all&mdash;not having
any children. You know what I am&mdash;an old maid.
You think that means the same thing as old bachelor.
Well, it don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old bachelor&mdash;nine times out of ten that means
simply an old, selfish, comfortable man. But an old
maid&mdash; The nature of woman&#8217;s different from the
nature of man. A woman&#8217;s got to have a home&mdash;<i>her</i>
home&mdash;her nest, with her children in it. And I&#8217;m an old
maid. If I&#8217;d been a man&mdash;&#8221; She turned on me.
&#8220;I&#8217;m ugly, ain&#8217;t I? You know I am. <i>I</i> know it.
Dress me up in men&#8217;s clothes and I&#8217;d be a good-looking
person&mdash;as a man. But as a woman I&#8217;m ugly. If I&#8217;d
have been a man I could have got a mighty nice, mighty
nice-looking wife&mdash;one that&#8217;d have been grateful to me
for taking her and would have cared for me. But as a
woman I couldn&#8217;t get a husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can get a very good one,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Money&mdash;what
would have bought you a wife as a man&mdash;what buys
most men their wives&mdash;will buy you a husband. And
he&#8217;ll be grateful and loving, so long as you manage the
purse strings well&mdash;just as most wives are loving and
grateful if their husbands don&#8217;t treat them too indulgently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s different, and you know it is,&#8221; retorted she.
&#8220;Custom has made it different. And I&#8217;m ugly&mdash;and
that&#8217;s fatal in a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charm will beat beauty every time,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got no charm&mdash;none on the outside. And
that&#8217;s where a woman&#8217;s charm has to be. No, I&#8217;ve
thought out my case. It&#8217;s hopeless. I&#8217;m a born old
maid. No man ever asked me to marry him. No man
ever said a word of love to me. Do you know what that
means, Godfrey?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>I was silent. A choke in my throat made speech
impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never a word of love,&#8221; she went on monotonously.
&#8220;Yet I don&#8217;t suppose any woman ever wanted to hear it
more. And no children. Yet I know no woman ever
wanted them more. No, not adopted children&mdash;but my
own flesh and blood. I&#8217;ve heard women complain of
the burden of bearing a child. It made me wild to
listen to them&mdash;the fools&mdash;the selfish fools! What
wouldn&#8217;t I have given to have felt a child within me.
Does it scandalize you to hear me talk like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I. &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder,&#8221; said she, with a grim smile. She
was quieting down, was hiding the heart from which she
had on impulse snatched the veil, was ashamed of her
outburst. &#8220;A woman can talk about having a cancer,
or a tumor, or any frightful disease inside her, and
nobody&#8217;s modesty is shocked. But if she speaks of
having a child within her&mdash;a wonderful, living human
being&mdash;a lovely baby&mdash;why, it&#8217;s immodest!&#8221; She gave
a scornful laugh. &#8220;What a world! What a world!&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her and marveled. What a world, indeed!&mdash;where
<i>this</i> was one of the sort of relatives of
whom pushing arrived people were ashamed!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I think I forced myself to stay three days with them.
I cannot recall; perhaps I left the second day. However
that may be, I have the sense of a long, a very long
visit. To one who has the city habit the country is
oppressively deliberate even when it is interesting. It
makes you realize how there is room, and to spare, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
sixty minutes in an hour, for sixty seconds in each
minute. The city entertains; the country compels you
to seek entertainment, to make entertainment. People
whose mentality tapers away from mediocrity grow old
and dull rapidly in the country as soon as childhood&#8217;s
torrential life begins to slacken. For men of thought
the country ought to be ideal, I should say, once they
formed its habit and lost the city habit of waiting in
confident expectation of being amused. But for men
of action like myself, for men whose whole life is dealing
directly with their fellow men, to acquire the country
habit is a matter of years, of a complete revolution.</p>

<p>I brought a sore and a sick heart to the country. I
took back to town one that was on the way toward the
normal. And I owed the improvement not to the
country directly, but to my sister. Polly Ann had reminded
me of the futility of graveyard mooning, of its
egotism and hypocrisy. She had reminded me that only
the fool walks backward through life. I believed I had
been guilty of the folly of blowing a bubble of delusion,
pretending to myself that it was no bubble, but permanent,
substantial, real. The bubble had burst, as bubbles
must&mdash;had burst with a mocking and irritating
dash of cold spray straight into my face. Well!&mdash;the
sensible thing to do, the only thing to do, was to laugh
and blow no more bubbles.</p>

<p>I went back to finance; I busied myself to the uttermost
of my capacity for work. But I could not uproot
the idea Mary Kirkwood had set growing in my mind.
I saw ever more clearly that my sister was eternally
right. Some men might be successful bachelors. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
could be fairly successful at that selfish and solitary
profession for a few years, perhaps for ten or fifteen
years longer. But I knew with the clearness of a vision
trained to search the horizon of the future that the
feeling of loneliness, of complete futility which already
shadowed me, would become a black pall. I <i>must</i> have
companionship; and to companionship there is but the
one way&mdash;the way of wife and children. A poor, an
uncertain way; nevertheless the only way.</p>

<p>You have, perhaps, observed the marriages of the
rich. You have noted that every rich man and every
rich woman is surrounded by a smaller or larger army
of satellites&mdash;persons nominally their social equals, often
distinctly their mental superiors, salaried persons, wearers
of cast-off clothing, eaters of luncheons and dinners,
permanent free lodgers, constant or occasional pensioners
more or less disguised. Family life fails with the
rich as it fails with the well off, or with the poor. But
while other classes revert to the herd life, the life of
clubs, saloons, teas, receptions, the rich take up the
parasite-beset life, each rich person aloof with his or her
particular circle of flatterers, attendants, coat-holders,
joke-makers, and boot-lickers.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that for me there could be no
enduring of this standing apart in the meadow, switching
my tail while parasites bit and tickled, buzzed and
burrowed. Riches, like any other heavy and constantly
growing responsibility, usually rob a man of his sense
of humor and turn his thoughts in upon himself and
make him a ridiculous ass of an egotist. They had not
had that effect upon me. I can give no reason; I simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span>
state the fact. So, with my sense of humor active, and
my sense of proportion fairly well balanced, I could not
give myself up to the dreary life custom assigns to the
rich. I retained the normal human instincts.</p>

<p>I had hoped to satisfy them to the uttermost with
the aid of Mary Kirkwood. That hope had fallen dead.
I must search on&mdash;not for the best conceivable, but for
the best possible.</p>

<p>You are not surprised at my lack of sentiment,
gentle reader. By this time, I am sure, I could not
surprise you with any exhibition of that or other depravity.
But it confirms your conviction of my utter
sordidness. So? Then you imagine, do you, that there
are many love marriages in the world, leaving out of
the count those in novels and in the twaddling gossip
men and women repeat as the true heart stories of this
and that person? Yes, I should say your intelligence
was about rudimentary enough to give you such a false
notion of life as it is lived. Marriages of passion there
are a-plenty. Rarely, indeed, does a man become bill-payer
to a woman for life&mdash;not to speak of the insurance&mdash;without
having been more or less agitated by her
physical charms; and usually the woman, eager to be
married, whips up for him a return feeling that looks
well, convinces the man and herself, and makes you,
gentle reader, sigh and wipe your sloppy eyes. But
love-marriage&mdash;that&#8217;s a wholly different matter. I
should say it almost never occurs. Where love, a sentiment
of slow and reluctant growth, does happen occasionally
to come afterwards, because the two are really
congenial, really mated&mdash;where love does come afterwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
it did not exist when the wedding bells rang.
And I doubt not that love has grown as often, if not
oftener, where the motives that led to the marriage were
practical and even sordid than where they were the
bright, swift fading, and in death most foul-smelling,
flowers of passion.</p>

<p>I was willing to buy a wife, if I could find a woman
who promised to wear well, to improve on acquaintance,
or, at least, not to deteriorate. And, beyond question,
with my money I could have taken my pick. Almost
any girl anywhere, engaged or unengaged, would have
fallen in love with me as soon as she discovered my
charms&mdash;of person and of purse. Yes, would have
fallen in love, gentle reader. Don&#8217;t you know that a
nice, pure girl always makes herself, or lets herself, fall
in love, before she gives herself? And don&#8217;t you know
that, except falling out of love&mdash;out of that kind of love&mdash;there&#8217;s
nothing easier, especially for an inexperienced
girl, than falling in love&mdash;in that kind of love?</p>

<p>But where was I to find a woman with enough solid
quality to give me a reasonable hope that she would aid
me in my quest for family happiness?</p>

<p>Do not denounce me, gentle reader. Epithet and
hiss are not reply. Answer my question.</p>

<p>You say there are millions of such girls. Yes?
But where?</p>

<p>You say there are millions of pure, sweet, charming
girls, intelligent and domestic. Yes. No doubt.
But how long would they remain so if tempted by
wealth, by the example of all the money-mad, luxury-mad,
society-mad women about them?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>Mind you, I did not want a stupid rotter, a cow, a
sitter and lounger and taker on of fat and slougher
off of intelligence. I did not want the lazy slattern
who poses as domestic, who is fond of home in
exactly the same way that a pig is fond of an alley
wallow.</p>

<p>You laugh at me. You say: &#8220;He is a conceited
fool!&mdash;to think that <i>he</i> could attract and absorb an intelligent
woman with a complex woman&#8217;s soul!&#8221; Not
so, gentle reader. I did not wish to attract and to absorb
her. As for the &#8220;complex woman&#8217;s soul,&#8221; the
less I saw or heard of it, the better pleased I&#8217;d be. I
simply wanted a woman who would join me in being
attracted by and absorbed in family life.</p>

<p>You are still smiling mockingly. But let me tell
you a few secrets of wisdom and happiness. First&mdash;Friendship
is divine, but intimacy is the devil himself&mdash;unless
it is the intimacy of the family. Second&mdash;To
love your neighbor as yourself, he must be and must
remain your neighbor, that is to say, within hail, but
not within touch. Third&mdash;Husband, wife, and children
are the only natural intimates&mdash;intimate because they
have the bond of common interest. The family that
looks abroad for intimates has ceased to be a family.
Finally&mdash;A man who has his wife and children for intimates
has neither need nor time for other intimates;
and unless a man&#8217;s wife and children are his intimates,
he has, in fact, no wife and no children. Let me add,
for the benefit of&mdash;perhaps of you and your husband,
gentle reader&mdash;that the only career worth having is
built upon and with efficient work; careers made with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>
friendships, gaddings, pulls, and the like would better
be left unmade.</p>

<p>You are smiling still, in your smug, supercilious
fashion&mdash;smiling at what you promptly call old-fashioned
trite truisms. I am not sure that, after they have
been thought about a while, they would seem old-fashioned
or stale. Rather, I flatter myself, they are the
statement of a new philosophy of life. For the old
theory with which you are confusing these truths was
that the family is the <i>social unit</i>. In fact, it is not;
the only <i>social</i> units are individuals&mdash;capable individuals.
My theory, or rather my philosophy&mdash;for it is
more than a theory&mdash;my philosophy is that the family
is the <i>unit of happiness</i>. Society can&mdash;and does&mdash;get
along fairly well with little or no happiness. But happiness
is an excellent thing, nevertheless. And <i>I</i>
wanted it.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps, you see why I was not looking forward
with any exuberance of optimism to finding the
woman whom I needed and wanted, and who needed and
wanted me. Prompted by my experiences and guided
somewhat by my shrewd and cynical friend Bob Armitage,
I had been giving no small amount of spare time
to observing and thinking about the American woman.
And while I admired that charming lady and found her
an amusing companion for an occasional leisure hour,
I saw that she was not to be taken seriously by a serious
person. She knew how to look well, how to make
a good &#8220;front,&#8221; how to get perhaps a hundred dollars
worth of pleasing surface results by squandering a
thousand or two thousand dollars. As an ornament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
a decoration, as a basket of rare inedible fruit to irradiate
lovely costliness, she could not be beaten. As wife
to a showy plutocrat, ignorant of the art of comfortable
living, as head mistress to an European noble with
servants trained to maintain his state in splendid and
orderly discomfort, she would do excellently well. But
not for the practical uses of sensible life. She had no
training for them, no taste for them, no intention of
adapting herself to them, whatever she might pretend
in order to catch a bill-payer.</p>

<p>Still, I did not despair. I dared not despair. If I
had, loneliness&mdash;and heartache, yes, heartache&mdash;and
my sense of present and future futility would have become
intolerable. On the other hand, while there was
every reason for haste&mdash;when happiness was my goal,
and life is short and uncertain&mdash;I was resolved to be
deliberate. If I should be deceived&mdash;perhaps by the
girl&#8217;s honest self-deception&mdash;into choosing wrong, how
she would hate me! For not again would, or could I
let a woman use me as Edna had used me. A fool is a
grown-up person who has never grown up. I had
grown up&mdash;had become a definite person, knowing what
I wanted and what I did not want. Such persons are
hated by those who try in vain to use them. My one
chance lay in finding a woman with the same definite
tastes as mine. Only disaster could come through the
woman who might marry me, pretending to agree with
me and secretly resolved to &#8220;redeem&#8221; me once she got
me firmly in her grasp.</p>

<p>Armitage was back in New York, was eager to resume
our old relations. But that could not be. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
outgrown him. And he, at the dangerous age, was allowing
himself to harden into all the habits of the rich
class and of middle life. Despite his efforts to conceal
it, I saw that he had even reached the pass where a
man of property regards a new idea as a menace to
society. If it is a new invention, it may make some
stock he owns worthless. If it is a new social or political
idea it may make his laborers demand higher wages,
or in some other way affect his dividends. And, of
course, whenever a man speaks of a menace to society,
he means a menace to himself whom he naturally regards
as the most precious and vital thread in the
social fabric. Compelled by my need for ideas to
occupy me in supplement to the now thoroughly familiar
and rather monotonous routine of investing and
reinvesting, organizing and reorganizing, I was associating
more and more with artists and writers of
the sort who feel suffocated in the society of the merely
rich.</p>

<p>Material conditions force upon men inexorable modes
of life. And every mode of life breeds a definite, distinct
set of ideas. Men fancy themselves original because
they suddenly discover certain ideas in their
brains. As well might a hen who has just eaten hot bran
fancy herself original because she laid an egg. The idea
was not from the man, but from his material conditions&mdash;lawyer
idea, politician idea, banker idea, anarchist
idea, big or little merchant idea, dog-fighter idea, professor
idea, preacher idea, and so on. I was fighting to
escape this to me repellent molding process&mdash;and I was
making headway. But poor Armitage was rapidly yielding;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
his struggle, I fear, had been in its best days in
large part a brassy make-believe&mdash;the valor of the trumpet,
not of the sword.</p>

<p>He was a sorry sight. His once handsome face was
taking on that petty, pinched, frost-bitten Fifth Avenue
expression. And he had been driven for companionship
into forming the familiar parasite circle. The chief
figures in it were a decaying dandy of an old New York
family who had been fawner and crumb snapper all his
days, and a broken-down plutocrat who had squandered
his fortune on fine women, fine wine, and fine food. The
dandy gave Bob the fashionable gossip; the broken-down
plutocrat gave him the gossip and scandal of the
giddy part of town, also the latest gamey stories; also
he&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;arranged for him the peculiar pleasures
of the rich man with the palate that needs strong
sensations to make it respond.</p>

<p>Armitage was out of the question for me. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I drifted into the Amsterdam Club one evening&mdash;to
write a note or send a telegram&mdash;and there sat Hartley
Beechman. The instant he saw me he sprang up and
made straight for me. His expression was puzzling, but
not hostile&mdash;still, I was unobtrusively ready. Said he
in a straight, frank fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Loring, I want to apologize to you. I made a
damned ass of myself in Green Park last summer. My
excuse is that I was more than half crazy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I put out my hand. &#8220;I half guessed at the time,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;I know all about it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>We looked at each other with the friendliness that
has become the stronger by a mended break&mdash;for broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
hearts and broken lives and broken friendships are much
the stronger if the break mends. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;One way of measuring the strength of a man is the
length of the intervals between the times when he makes
a fool of himself about a woman. My first came at
eighteen, my next at thirty-eight. Not a bad showing,
I flatter myself&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncommonly good,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the second shall be the last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Optimism!&#8221; I warned him laughingly. &#8220;Beware
of optimism!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I shall write about women, but I&#8217;ll see no more
of them. I&#8217;ve got hold of myself again. I&#8217;m as good
as ever&mdash;better than ever, probably. But&mdash;it cost! And
I&#8217;ll not pay that price again. For a while I thought it
was you who had upset my happiness. Then&mdash;&#8221; He
gave a loud, unnatural laugh&mdash;&#8220;That German purchase!
I saw she had been simply playing with me. You know
how fond women of that sort are of playing with romantic
or sentimental ideas. But when it came to the test&mdash;why,
she would have married only a fortune or a title.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no comment. He was saying only what I
thought, what I believed true. But I hated to hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may wrong her,&#8221; pursued he reflectively. &#8220;Not
altogether, but to a certain extent. I rather think the
impulse to something saner and less vulgar was there&mdash;actually
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he was looking at me inquiringly I said: &#8220;I
think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;nothing came of it. And there&#8217;s little in
these fine impulses of which nothing comes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>&#8220;Little?&#8221; laughed I. &#8220;Why, they produce the most
beautiful decorative effects. Life would be barren without
them. What a repulsive sight the poor little human
animal would be, grunting and grubbing about, thinking
always of its beloved self&mdash;what a repulsive sight if it
didn&#8217;t wear the flowers of high ideals in its ears&mdash;and
the jewels of fine impulses ringed in its nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> think it would look better without them,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Less ridiculous&mdash;less contemptible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you&mdash;yes. Because you&#8217;re like I am&mdash;coarse.
But not to itself and its fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the woods to-morrow,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better come on a yachting trip to South America
with me,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He flushed. &#8220;Thank you&mdash;but I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; replied
he. &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my turn to flush. &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;I spoke without thinking&mdash;spoke on impulse.
You are quite right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s a fool or a sycophant who goes where he
can&#8217;t pay his own way,&#8221; continued he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to
realize that. I&#8217;ll do it no more. I&#8217;ll stick to my own
class. I&#8217;ve been justly punished for blundering out of
it. But not so severely punished as I should have been
had my&mdash;&#8221; he smiled ironically&mdash;&#8220;my love affair prospered.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought for several minutes, then he said: &#8220;I
wonder&mdash;when the clash came&mdash;would I have gone with
her or she with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not reply.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together, smiled mockingly at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
own folly of lingering near the unsightly and not too
aromatic corpse. &#8220;I must get into the woods and
breathe it out of my system. Did you see the account
of the arrangements for her approaching marriage in
this evening&#8217;s paper? Nearly a page&mdash;and I read every
line.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had finished his drink he rose and departed&mdash;and
I have not talked with him since. He resumed his
career; we all know how brilliant it is. As I have said
before, I have no sympathy with the silly notion, bruited
about by silly flabby people that women ruin the lives
of strong men. Now and then a woman may be the
proverbial last straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back. But
there&#8217;s a vast difference between woman the actuality,
woman the mere last straw, and woman the vampire, the
scarlet destroyer as portrayed in novels and so-called
histories. Those mighty men, made or ruined by women&mdash;why
do we never <i>see</i> them, why do we only read about
them?</p>

<p>I resisted the temptation to follow Beechman&#8217;s example
and read the newspaper account of Mary Kirkwood&#8217;s
approaching apotheosis into the heaven that is
the dream of all true American ladies. There is but
one way to do a thing&mdash;and that is to do it. I had
destroyed or sent back the letters; I had resisted the telegram.
I could not yet bar my mind from wandering to
her. But I could avoid leading it to her&mdash;and I did.
So it was by accident that, the following week, I one
morning let my eye take in the whole of a four-line newspaper
paragraph before I realized what it was about.
The purport was that the engagement between Count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>
von Tilzer-Borgfeldt and Mrs. Kirkwood had been
broken off because of a &#8220;failure to agree as to settlements.&#8221;
This, in the same newspaper that contained
two columns descriptive of the quietly gorgeous marriage
of Frascatoni and Edna in my son-in-law&#8217;s new
house near London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Failure to agree as to settlements&mdash;&#8221; Faugh!</p>

<p>I had calmed until all my anger against her was
gone and I was thinking of her as merely human, as the
result of her environment like everyone else. I believed
now that where she had deceived me she had also deceived
herself. And I saw as clearly as in the days of
my infatuation that she and I had been made for each
other, that our coming together had been one of those
rare meetings of two who are entirely congenial. It
filled me with sadness that fate had not been kind instead
of sardonically cruel, had not brought us together ten
years earlier, before the world had poisoned her originally
simple and sincere nature. But how absurd to
linger over impossible might-have-beens! I had gone as
far as I cared to go in the company of those who have
made fools of themselves for love.</p>

<p>I believed I could trust myself with her in the same
neighborhood. But I was not sure, and I would take no
chance. A few days after I read of the broken engagement
I departed on the yachting trip to South America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were but two in my party&mdash;Dugdale, the
playwright, and myself. A more amusing man than
Dugdale never lived. He was amusing both consciously
and unconsciously. A mountain of a man&mdash;bone and
muscle, little fat. He had eyes that were large, but
were so habitually squinted, the better to see every detail
of everything, that they seemed small; and his expression,
severe to the verge of savageness, changed the
instant he spoke into childlike simplicity and good humor.
He made money easily&mdash;large sums of money&mdash;for
he had the talent for success. But he spent long
before he made. I think it must have been his secret
ambition to owe everybody in the world&mdash;except his
friends. From a friend he never borrowed. The general
belief was that he had never paid back a loan&mdash;and
I have no reason to doubt it. What did he do with
his borrowings? Loaned them to his friends who were
hard up. If the list of those he owed was long, the list
of those who owed him was longer. If he never paid
back, neither was he ever paid.</p>

<p>He could work at sea, or anywhere else&mdash;no doubt
even in a balloon. On that trip he toiled prodigiously,
crouched over a foolish little table in his cabin, smoking
endless cigarettes and setting down with incredible rapidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>
illegible words in a tiny writing that contrasted grotesquely
with the enormous hand holding the pencil. He
labored altogether at night, after I had gone to bed.
He was always astir before me. He slept unbelievably
little, probably kept up on the quantities of whisky he
drank. However that may be, he was as active by day
physically as he was mentally by night. He was all
over the boat, always finding something to do&mdash;something
for me as well as for himself.</p>

<p>The only terms on which Dugdale would consent to
go were that I should keep him away from New York not
less than two months, and that I should take no one else.
I promptly assented to both conditions. It was not the
first time he had put me under a heavy debt of gratitude
for congenial society. We had made several long trips
together, always with satisfaction on both sides. Whatever
else you may think of me, I hope I have at least convinced
you that I am not one of those rich men who rely
for consideration upon their wealth. I believe I am one
of the few rich men who can justly claim that distinction.
When I ask a man less well off than I am to dine with me&mdash;or
to accept my hospitality in any way&mdash;I ask him
because I want him. And I do not either directly or indirectly
try to make him feel that he is being honored. I
would not ask the sort of man who feels honored by
being in the society of bank accounts or of any other
glittering symbols in substitute for good-fellowship.</p>

<p>You will see, gentle reader, that my list was short
indeed.</p>

<p>It is one of the not few drawbacks of riches that
they rouse the instinct of cupidity in nearly all human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
beings. The rich man glances round at a circle of constrained
faces, each more or less unsuccessfully striving
to veil from him the glistening eye and the watery lip
of the gold hunger. Probably you know how pepsin is
got for the market&mdash;how they pen pigs so that their
snouts almost touch food which they can by no straining
and struggling reach; how the unhappy creatures soon
begin to drip, then to slobber, then to stream into the
receiving trough under their jaws the pepsin which the
sight of the food starts their stomachs to secreting. As
I have looked at the parasite circles of some of my friends
I have often been reminded of the pepsin pigs. Some of
my friends like these displays, encourage them in every
way, associate solely with pepsin pigs. I confess I have
never acquired the least taste for that sort of entertainment.</p>

<p>I have traveled the world over, and everywhere I
have found men either industriously engaged in cringing
or looking hopefully about for some one to cringe
to them. Well&mdash;what of it?</p>

<p>I owe Dugdale a debt I cannot hope to repay. He,
a light-hearted philosopher, made me light-hearted. He
kept my sense of humor and my sense of proportion
constantly active. There is a stripe of philosopher of
the light-hearted variety who lets his perception of the
fundamental futility of life and all that therein is discourage
him from everything but cynical laughter at
himself and at the world. That sort is a shallow ass,
fit company for no one but the bleary, blowsy wrecks
to whose level he rapidly sinks. Dugdale&mdash;and I&mdash;were
of the other school. We did not&mdash;at least, not habitually&mdash;exaggerate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
our own importance. It caused no
swelling of the head in him that his name was known
wherever people went to the theater, or in me that I
usually had to be taken into account when they did anything
important in finance. We did not measure the
world or rank its inhabitants according to the silly
standards in general use. But at the same time we
appreciated that to work and to work well was the only
sensible way to pass the few swift years assigned us.</p>

<p>It takes a serious man to make even a good joke. A
frivolous person can do nothing. That is why so many
of our American women, and so many of the men, too,
sink into insignificance as soon as the first freshness of
youth is gone from them. Youth has charm simply as
youth because it seems to be a brilliant promise. When
the promise goes to protest the charm vanishes.</p>

<p>I shall reserve what I saw and heard in South America
for another volume, one of a different kind. I shall
go forward to the following spring when I was once
more in New York. Edna and her daughter&mdash;so I read
in the newspapers&mdash;were living in fitting estate in a famous
villa they had taken in the fashionable part of the
south of France, &#8220;for the health of the two young sons
of the marchioness.&#8221; Frascatoni was gambling at Monte
Carlo, Crossley was at his government post in London.
I could fill in the tiresome details for both the wives and
the husbands&mdash;and so, probably, can you. While some
business matters were settling, I was turning over in my
mind plans for making a systematic search for a wife.</p>

<p>I count on your amusement confidently, gentle reader.
If you wished a fresh egg for your breakfast or a suit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span>
of clothes to be worn a few weeks and discarded, or an
automobile, you would set about getting it with some
attention to the best ways and means. But, saturated
as you are with silly sentimentalities about marriage,
you believe that the most important matter in the world&mdash;the
matter which determines your own happiness or unhappiness
and also the current of posterity&mdash;you believe
that such a matter should be left to the lottery of chance!
Well, I had long since abandoned that delusion, and I
purposed to establish my life with as much thought and
care as I gave all other matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dull fellow,&#8221; you are saying. &#8220;No wonder his
wife fled from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not wonder that you regard as dull anything
that is intelligent. To ignorance intelligence must necessarily
seem dull. When any subject of real interest is
brought up, some silly, empty-headed pretty woman is
sure to say, &#8220;How dull! Let&#8217;s talk of something interesting.&#8221;
And there will always be a chorus of laughing
assent&mdash;because the woman is pretty. So I accept your
sneer at me with a certain pleasure. I wish to be thought
dull by some people, including some women very good to
look at. But out of vanity and in fairness to Edna I
must acquit her of having thought me dull&mdash;after she
had been about the world.</p>

<p>One evening at the Federal Club I fell in with my
old acquaintance, Sam Cauldwell, the fashionable physician.
He was something more than that&mdash;or had been&mdash;but
was too lazy to use his mind when his gift for sympathetic
and flattering gab brought him in plenty of
money. Cauldwell was a trained, thoroughgoing sycophant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span>
and snob. But he saw the humorous aspect of the
gods he was on his knees before&mdash;and saw the humor of
his being there. He knew the kind of man I was, and
liked to take me aside and make sport of his deities for
an hour over a bottle of wine. Also&mdash;he liked the idea
of being, and of being seen, intimate with a man conspicuous
for wealth and for the social position of his
family&mdash;the ex-husband of a princess, the father of a
marchioness. Gentle reader, if you wish to see human
nature to its depth, you must occupy such a position as
mine. Believe me, you are mistaken in thinking the traits
you shamedly hide are unique. There are others like you&mdash;many
others.</p>

<p>Cauldwell was perhaps ten years older than I, but
being a well-taken-care-of New Yorker, he passed for a
young man&mdash;which, indeed, he was. I do not regard
fifty as anything but young unless it insists upon another
estimate by looking older than it really is. I shall
assuredly be young at fifty, perhaps younger than I am
now, for I take better care of my health every year&mdash;and
I have health worth taking care of. But, as I was
about to say, Cauldwell had a meditative look that night
as we sat down to dinner together. And when he had
drunk his third glass of champagne he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Loring, why the devil don&#8217;t you get married?&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt that he had something especial to say to me.
I answered indifferently, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very simple,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;Not rich enough. To
marry in New York a man must be either a pauper or
a Cr&#339;sus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then marry a rich girl,&#8221; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d have done it long ago if I could,&#8221; he confessed
with a laugh. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve never been able to get at the
girls who are rich enough. Their mammas guard them
for plutocrats or titles. But you&mdash; Really, it&#8217;s a shame
for you to stay single. I know a dozen women who&#8217;re
losing sleep longing for you&mdash;for themselves, or for some
lovely young daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pathetic,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that irritates you. Well&mdash;you needn&#8217;t be
alarmed. You&#8217;re famed for being about the wariest
bird in the preserves. And I know you don&#8217;t want that
kind of woman. Why not take the kind you do want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could name a dozen,&#8221; rejoined he. &#8220;But I shan&#8217;t
name any. I have one in mind. A doctor has the best
opportunity in the world to find out about women&mdash;about
men, too&mdash;the truth about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;If I wanted misinformation about
human nature,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;d go to a doctor&mdash;or a
preacher. They&#8217;re the depositories of all the hysterical
tommyrot, all the sentimental lies that vain women and
men think out about themselves and their sex relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>His smile was not a denial. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been rather
credulous, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And men and women
do tell the most astounding whoppers about themselves.
Especially women, having trouble with their husbands.
I try not to believe, but I&#8217;m caught every once in a
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gleam in his eye made me wonder whether he
wasn&#8217;t thinking of some yarn Edna had spun for him
about me. Probably. There are precious few women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>
even among the fairly close-mouthed, who don&#8217;t take
advantage of the family doctor to indulge in the passion
for romancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t thinking of any confession,&#8221; he went
on. &#8220;Several women have confessed a secret passion
for you to me&mdash;with the hope that I&#8217;d help them. The
woman I have in mind isn&#8217;t that sort. I don&#8217;t know
that she cares anything about you. I only know that
she&#8217;s exactly the woman for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Interesting,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s young&mdash;unusually pretty&mdash;and in a distinguished
way. She knows how to run a house as a home&mdash;and
she&#8217;s about the only woman I know in our class
who does. She&#8217;s got a good mind&mdash;not for a woman,
but for anybody. And she needs a husband and children
and a home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He must have misunderstood the peculiar expression
of my face, for he hastened on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that she&#8217;s poor. On the contrary, she&#8217;s rich.
I&#8217;d not recommend a poor girl to you. Poor girls can
think of nothing but money&mdash;naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody, rich and poor, thinks of money&mdash;naturally,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; laughed he. &#8220;But it <i>looks</i>
worse in a poor girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say the opposite. A feeding glutton
looks worse than a feeding famished man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate&mdash;this woman I have in mind isn&#8217;t poor.
That&#8217;s not a disadvantage, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a hopeless obstacle,&#8221; said I. &#8220;By the way,
what <i>are</i> her disadvantages?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>&#8220;Well&mdash;she&#8217;s been married before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, on the other hand, she has no children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither have I,&#8221; said I, without thinking. I
hastened to add, &#8220;My only child is married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And splendidly married,&#8221; said he with the snob&#8217;s
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;To return to the lady,&#8221; said I dryly. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you marry her yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had drunk several more glasses of the champagne.
He laughed. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t look at <i>me</i>. She sees
straight through me. She wants a man with domestic
tastes. I&#8217;m about as fit for domestic life as a fire-engine
horse for an old maid&#8217;s ph&aelig;ton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;who is it?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll think she&#8217;s been at me to help
her. But, on my honor, Loring, she isn&#8217;t that sort.
We&#8217;ve talked of you. For some reason, ever since I&#8217;ve
known her&mdash;well, I&#8217;ve never seen her without thinking
of you. I often talk of you to her&mdash;not marrying talk&mdash;I&#8217;d
not dare&mdash;but in a friendly sort of way. She
listens&mdash;says nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is sickly,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sickly?&#8221; he cried. He looked horrified and amazed.
&#8220;Good Lord, what gave you that notion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you saw her often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. It was her brother who had the illness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Bring her round and I&#8217;ll look her
over,&#8221; said I carelessly. And I forced a change of
subject.</p>

<p>Had Mary Kirkwood been taking this agreeable, insidious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
doctor into her confidence? I did not know. I
do not know. I have reasons for thinking he told the
literal truth. And yet&mdash;women are queer about
doctors. However, that&#8217;s a small matter. The thing
that impressed me, that agitated me as he talked, was
the picture he, by implication, was making of Mary
Kirkwood, alone again, and evidently absolutely unattached&mdash;living
alone in the country as when I first knew
her.</p>

<p>I tossed and fretted away most of the hours of that
night with the result that at breakfast I resolved to leave
town again, to put the width of the continent or of the
ocean between me and temptation to folly. But one
thing and another came up to detain me. It was perhaps
ten days later that I, walking alone in the Park, as
was my habit, found myself at a turning face to face
with her. I don&#8217;t think my expression reflected credit
upon my boasted self-control. As for her&mdash;I thought
she was going to faint&mdash;and she is not one of the fainting
kind. We gazed at each other in fright and embarrassment,
and both had the same child&#8217;s impulse to
turn and fly&mdash;one, of those sensible, natural instincts
for the shortest way out of difficult situations that the
cowardly conventionality of the grown-up estate makes
it impossible to obey. But&mdash;we had to do something.
So, we laughed.</p>

<p>She put out her hand; I took it. &#8220;How well you
are looking,&#8221; said I&mdash;and it was the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>I turned to walk with her. We strolled along cheerfully
and contentedly, talking of the early spring, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span>
flowers, and birds, and such neutral matters. I was
fluent, she no less so. Our agitation disappeared; our
sense of congeniality returned. Our acquaintance
seemed to have lumped back to where it was before we
had that first confidential talk together on the yacht.
After perhaps an hour, as agreeable an hour as I ever
spent, she said she must go home, as she had an engagement.
On the way to the Sixty-fifth Street entrance
the conversation lagged somewhat. We were both
busily resolving the same thing&mdash;the matter of explanations.
Now that I was seeing her again&mdash;a wholly different
matter from inspecting my defaced and smirched
and battered image of her&mdash;battered by the blows of my
jealousy, and anger, and scorn&mdash;now that I was seeing
<i>her</i> again, I could not but see and feel that she was in
reality a sweet and simple and attractive woman. No
doubt she had her faults&mdash;as all of us have&mdash;grave
faults of inheritance, of education, of environment. But
who was I that I should sit in judgment on her? I
realized that I had judged her unjustly so far as
her treatment of me was concerned. Assuming that
she was tainted with snobbishness, assuming that her
defects were as bad as I had thought in my worst
paroxysms, still that did not alter the charms and the
fine qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are friends?&#8221; said I abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said she. She added: &#8220;I know so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without discussion or explanation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is best&mdash;don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; replied she. &#8220;I
am&mdash;not&mdash;not proud of some things I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I, of some things I did.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span>&#8220;I should like to forget them&mdash;my own and yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too. And explanations do not explain. Let
sleeping dogs lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled and nodded. She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The latter part of the week I&#8217;m going back to the
country. Perhaps you&#8217;ll spend Saturday and Sunday
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Let me know at the
Federal Club if your plans change.&#8221;</p>

<p>At her door we shook hands, but both lingered.
Said she:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad we are friends again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was inevitable,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;We <i>like</i> each
other too well not to have come round. Bitternesses
and enmities are stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And sad,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>When we met again&mdash;at her house in the country&mdash;there
was no constraint on either side. We knew that
neither of us had the power to breach, much less to remove,
the barrier between us. We ignored its existence&mdash;and
were content.</p>

<p>You may have observed that I have rarely been able
to speak of Edna without resentment. I shall now tell
you why:</p>

<p>The friendship between Mary Kirkwood and me presently
set the newspaper gossips to talking. Our engagement
was announced again and again&mdash;the announcement
always a pretext for rehashing the story of the matrimonial
bankruptcy through which each had passed. But as
we were above the reach of the missiles of the scandalmongers
the worst that was printed produced only a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span>
and brief irritation. This until the Princess Frascatoni
began her campaign of slander.</p>

<p>I shall not go into it. I shall simply say that she
ordered one of her hangers-on&mdash;one of the semi-literary
parasites to be found in the train of every rich person&mdash;to
attack Mary and me as keeping up an intrigue of
long standing, the one that was the real cause of my
wife&#8217;s divorcing me. When I read the first of these
articles I believed, from certain details, that no one in the
world but the Princess Frascatoni could have inspired it.
But with my habitual caution I leashed my impetuous
anger and did not condemn her until I had investigated.
Is it not strange, is it not the irony of fate that in every
serious crisis of my life, except one, I should have had
coolness and self-control, and that the one exception
should have been when I loved Mary Kirkwood and condemned
her unheard? After all, I am not sure that love
isn&#8217;t a kind of lunacy.</p>

<p>Why did Edna engage in that campaign of slander?
Why did she say to everyone from this side the most malicious,
the most mendacious things about my relations
with Mrs. Kirkwood&mdash;that she had ignored the intrigue
as long as she could for the sake of her dear daughter;
that it had driven her from New York, had forced her to
get a divorce, and so on through the gamut of malignant
lying? There may perhaps be a clew to the mystery in
the failure of her second marriage&mdash;as a marriage, I
mean; not, of course, as a social enterprise, for there it
was a world-renowned success. If the clew is not in
Edna&#8217;s emptiness of heart and boredom, then I can suggest
no explanation. I imagine she had been hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span>
and reading the gossip about an impending marriage
between Mrs. Kirkwood and me until she had concluded
that there must be truth in it&mdash;and by outrageous slander
she hoped to make it impossible.</p>

<p>The first effect was as she had probably calculated.
Mary and I avoided each other. Mary hid herself and
would see no one. Armitage and I for a time kept up a
pretense of close friendship, or, rather, publicly again
pretended a friendship that had long since all but ceased.
But when the talk both in the newspapers and among our
acquaintances grew until the &#8220;at last uncovered scandal&#8221;
was the chief topic of gossip, he and I almost
stopped speaking. You may wonder why he or I or both
of us did not &#8220;do something&#8221; to crush the absurd lie.
Gentle reader, did you ever try to kill a scandal? It is
done in novels and on the stage; but in life the silly ass
who draws his sword and attacks a pestilent fog accomplishes
nothing&mdash;beyond attracting more attention to the
fog by his absurd and futile gesticulations. The world
had made up its nasty little mind that the relations between
Mary Kirkwood, divorced, and Godfrey Loring,
divorced, were not, and for years had not been, what they
should be. And the matter was settled. I think Armitage
himself believed. I know Beechman believed, for he
pointedly crossed the street to avoid speaking to me.</p>

<p>I stood this for a month. Then I went down to
Mary&#8217;s place on Long Island.</p>

<p>You may imagine the excitement my coming caused
among the honest yeomanry gathered at the station&mdash;those
worthy folk who peep and pry into the business of
their fashionable overlords, and are learning to cringe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>
like English peasants. I found Mary setting out for a
ride&mdash;through her own grounds; she was ashamed to venture
abroad. I came upon her abruptly. Instead of the
terror and aversion I had steeled myself to meet, I got
a radiance of welcome that made my heart leap. But
in an instant she had remembered and was almost in a
panic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please send the groom away with the horse,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Let us walk up and down here before the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated, obeyed.</p>

<p>The broad space before the house was laid out in
hedges and blooming beds with a long, straight drive
leading in one direction to the highroad, in the other
direction to stable, carriage house, and garage. When
we were securely alone I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you missed me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friendship meant a lot to me,&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have discovered that it&#8217;s the principal thing in
my life,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>We paced the length of the drive toward the lodge in
silence. As we turned toward the house again I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have chartered the largest yacht I could get&mdash;for
a cruise round the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause, then she in a constrained voice: &#8220;When do
you start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Perhaps to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She halted, leaned against a tree, and gazed out
through the shrubbery.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not been well?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never am, when I lose interest in life,&#8221; replied she.
&#8220;You will be gone&mdash;long?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>&#8220;Long,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Either we shall not see each other
again for years&mdash;or&mdash;&#8221; I paused.</p>

<p>After a wait of fully a minute she looked inquiringly
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; said I, &#8220;shall we take a motor launch and
go over to Connecticut and be married?&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to walk again, I keeping pace with her.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the only sensible thing to do,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
only way out of this mess. And to-morrow we&#8217;ll sail
away and not come back until&mdash;until we are good and
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>I waited a moment, then went on, and I had the
feeling that I was saying what we were both thinking:
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had the same experience&mdash;have been through
the same bankruptcy. It has taught us, I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;I
can&#8217;t be sure; human nature learns slowly and badly.
But I see a good chance for us&mdash;not to be utterly and
always blissfully happy, but to get far more out of life
than either is getting&mdash;or could get alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we turned at the group of outbuildings she looked
at me and I at her&mdash;a look straight into each other&#8217;s
souls. And then and there was born that which alone
can make a marriage successful or a life worth the living.
What is the difference between friendship and love?
I had thought&mdash;and said&mdash;that love was friendship in
bloom. But as Mary and I looked at each other, I knew
the full truth. Love is friendship set on fire. We did
not speak. We glanced hastily away. At the front
door she halted. In a quiet, awed voice she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll change from this riding suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>And what did I say, gentle reader, to commemorate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
our standing upon holy ground? I did no better than
she. With eyes uncertain and voice untrustworthy and
hoarse I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell your maid to pack and go to town with
the trunks&mdash;go to the landing at East Twenty-third
Street. Can she be there by four or five this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll see you at the bay&mdash;at the launch wharf&mdash;in
half an hour? I&#8217;ve got to send off a telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In half an hour,&#8221; said she, and with a grave smile
and a wave of her crop she disappeared into the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At seven that evening we steamed past Sandy Hook.
At ten&mdash;after an almost silent dinner&mdash;we were on deck,
leaning side by side at the rail, near the bow. We were
alone on the calm and shining sea. No land in sight,
not a steamer, not a sail&mdash;not a sign of human existence
beyond the rail of our yacht. Her arm slipped within
mine; my hand sought hers. Not a sail, not a streamer
of smoke. Alone and free and together.</p>

<p>I forgive you, gentle reader. Go in peace.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
